  <p>Hi, I’m Roel. Welcome to my homepage! I’m a twenty-something dilettante from Manila who loves everything about languages. I’m an accountant by training and have worked in finance and fintech since graduating. I also write, and this website is home to my (mostly incoherent) ramblings.</p>
</section>
<section><p>I started this site in 2020 as a new place to self-host <a href="https://gimlafraogh.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my blog,</a> which by then had been running for some four or five years. Over time, however, the site grew to include bits and pieces of my other side projects.</p></section>

  <p>I have been writing for as long as I remember, although I’d normally shy away from calling myself a “writer”&mdash;or from calling myself by any other label, for that matter, which is why I always struggle more than what is necessary to write a single paragraph introducing myself. (I prefer to call myself an “observer,” but I realize that that sounds a lot more conceited than “writer” ever is.)</p>
  
  <h3 class="small-h3">A note on the design of this site</h3>
  
  <p>One of the reasons why I decided to abandon Wordpress was because of how clunky it could be. My original page was never interaction-heavy, as it’s main purpose was (and still is) to be a place where I can display the stuff I wrote or made. Thus the decision to make the whole site static. Thus Jekyll. I have tried to make this site as simple and as minimalistic as I could, and to some success I’d like to think.</p>
  
  <p>The main css file for this site has been forked from the Tufte-CSS project, which is itself inspired by the design philosophy of the American statistician Edward Tufte. I found it while searching for CSS frameworks that did a decent job dealing with footnotes (I can be fond of footnotes) and fell in love with how elegantly it made footnotes (read: sidenotes) appear for the web.</p>
