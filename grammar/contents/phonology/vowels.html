<h2>Vowels</h2>

<h3>Oral vowels</h3>
Iridian has five pairs of corresponding long and short vowels. With the exception of /a aː/, long vowels are tenser than their short counterparts. In addition
standard Iridian also features the high central vowel [ɨ] as an allophone of /ɛ/
and /ɪ/ and the low central [ɐ] as an allophone of /a/, in unstressed positions.
