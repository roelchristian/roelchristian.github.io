<h2>Vowels</h2>

<h3>Oral vowels</h3>
<p>Iridian has five pairs of corresponding long and short vowels. Vowel length is indicated in orthography by an accute accent (<span class="ird">sripka</span>) over the vowel. With the exception of /a aː/, long vowels are tenser than their short counterparts. In addition
standard Iridian also features the high central vowel [ɨ] as an allophone of /ɛ/ and /ɪ/ and the low central [ɐ] as an allophone of /a/, in unstressed positions.

<h3>Diphthongs</h3>
<p>Iridian has three phonemic oral diphthongs: au /au̯ /, ei /eɪ̯/ and ou /ou̯ /.
In addition, the diphthongs oi /ɔɪ̯/ and ui /uɪ̯/ also occur phonetically, but
their occurence is marginal, normally appearing only in fixed expressions
(mostly interjections and expletives), such as <span class="ird">Avui</span>,
‘Damn it!’ [ʔɐˈʋuɪ̯ʔ], <span class="ird">pšehui</span>, ‘annoying’ [ˈpɕɛxuɪ̯ʔ]
and <span class="ird">Oi</span>, ‘Hey!’ [ʔɔɪ̯ʔ]. Even then, /uɪ̯/, and less commonly,
/ɔɪ̯/ may be realized as [yː] or [iː] (the latter is more common in southern dialects
and the former elsewhere).

<p>In most dialects the diphthong /eɪ̯/ has almost completely merged with é
/eː/, although some divergent dialects in the south may realise the diphthong
as [iː] (e.g., neite, ‘word’ /ˈneɪ̯tɛ/ but realised as [ˈneːtɛ] or [ˈɲiːtɛ]).


<h2>Consonants</h2>

<h3>Plosives</h3>
<p>Initial velar stops are affricated when following a pause, so that the pair /k ɡ/
is often realised as [k͡x ɡ͡ɣ]. Some Southeastern dialects, however, normally
realise initial velar stops as aspirated [kʰ ɡʰ] instead. This sound change can
be traced to the initial aspirated stops *kʰ, *gʰ, *tʰ, and *dʰ in Old Iridian
weakening to affricates. The labial stops /p b/ are unaffected by this process
as most instances of *pʰ and *bʰ have merged to /b/ or /ʋ/ in modern Iridian.
The velar stops /k ɡ/ are lenited to the velar fricatives [x ɣ] intervocalically,
before a voiceless stop, after a vocalised l if followed by another vowel or a
voiceless stop, or before the nasal consonants /n/ or /m/ if following a vowel
immediately. This lenition also occurs word-finally unless followed by a voiced
obstruent, in which case, subject to word-final devoicing, they merge to [x].
The voiced /ɡ/ itself has a limited distribution, mostly appearing in consonant
clusters with liquids or nasals.
  
<p>This lenition can also be observed with the voiced stops /b/ and /d/ which
become the approximants [β̞ ] and [ð̞] (written without the diacritic hereafter)
intervocalically or between a vocalised /l/ and another vowel.

<p>The glottal stop [ʔ] is often not regarded as a separate phoneme. It can
occur in three cases: (1) before an onset vowel when following a pause, e.g.,
avt, ‘car’ [ʔäʋt]; (2) between two vowels that do not form a diphthong, e.g.,
naomá, ‘laundry’ [’näʔɔmäː]; or (3) emphatically, especially in interjections,
e.g., Oi, ‘Hey!’ [ʔɔɪ̯ʔ], Káp!, ‘Look out!’ lit., ‘danger’ [k͡xäpʔ].
  
<h3>Nasals</h3>
<p>Iridian has three nasal consonants /m n ɲ/. /n/ cannot appear before bilabials
and similarly /m/ cannot appear before velars. Both /m/ and /n/ are
realised as [m] before either /ʋ/ or /f/. Before velars /n/ is consistently realised
as [ŋ], although [n] is also possible in emphatic pronunciation or in word
boundaries.
<p>The velar [ŋ] is not phonemic in Iridian but can sometimes be observed,
especially in loanwords, where it can be realised as nasalisation of the preceding
vowel when in the syllable coda or as [ŋ] intervocalically, although [ŋɡ] or
[ŋk] is also common. Thus, for example, anglevní, ‘English’ can be realised as
either [ˈäŋlɛʋɲiː] or [ˈäŋɡlɛʋɲiː] in order of currency.

<h3>Liquids</h3>
Iridian has three liquids: the rhotic /r/ and the lateral /l/ and /l/.
The rhotic /r/ is realised in one of three ways. Word-initially it is
pronounced as the uvular fricative [ʁ] (or as the uvular trill fricative [ʀ̝], depending
on the speaker, but both transcribed here simply as [ʁ]). The realisation as [ʁ]
is also often used when pronouncing words emphatically. When in the coda
position and before a pause /r/ is realised as [ɾʑ] or simply as [ʑ].
This pronunciation was originally that of a voiceless alveolar trill [r̥ ] but this has simplified
to [r̝] and finally to [ɾʑ] or [ʑ] in Standard Iridian. The pronunciation as [r̥ ]
