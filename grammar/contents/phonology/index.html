<h2>Vowels</h2>

<h3>Oral vowels</h3>
Iridian has five pairs of corresponding long and short vowels. With the exception of /a aː/, long vowels are tenser than their short counterparts. In addition
standard Iridian also features the high central vowel [ɨ] as an allophone of /ɛ/
and /ɪ/ and the low central [ɐ] as an allophone of /a/, in unstressed positions.
As in Czech,

<h3>Diphthongs</h3>
<p>Iridian has three phonemic oral diphthongs: au /au̯ /, ei /eɪ̯/ and ou /ou̯ /.
In addition, the diphthongs oi /ɔɪ̯/ and ui /uɪ̯/ also occur phonetically, but
their occurence is marginal, normally appearing only in fixed expressions
(mostly interjections and expletives), such asAvui, ‘Damn it!’ [ʔɐˈʋuɪ̯ʔ], pšehui,
‘annoying’ [ˈpɕɛxuɪ̯ʔ] and Oi, ‘Hey!’ [ʔɔɪ̯ʔ].
<p>In most dialects the diphthong /eɪ̯/ has almost completely merged with é
/eː/, although some divergent dialects in the south may realise the diphthong
as [iː] (e.g., neite, ‘word’ /ˈneɪ̯tɛ/ but realised as [ˈneːtɛ] or [ˈɲiːtɛ]).
