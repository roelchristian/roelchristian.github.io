<h2>Vowels</h2>

<h3>Oral vowels</h3>
<p>Iridian has five pairs of corresponding long and short vowels. Vowel length is indicated in orthography by an accute accent (<span class="ird">sripka</span>) over the vowel. With the exception of /a aː/, long vowels are tenser than their short counterparts. In addition
standard Iridian also features the high central vowel [ɨ] as an allophone of /ɛ/ and /ɪ/ and the low central [ɐ] as an allophone of /a/, in unstressed positions.

<h3>Diphthongs</h3>
<p>Iridian has three phonemic oral diphthongs: au /au̯ /, ei /eɪ̯/ and ou /ou̯ /.
In addition, the diphthongs oi /ɔɪ̯/ and ui /uɪ̯/ also occur phonetically, but
their occurence is marginal, normally appearing only in fixed expressions
  (mostly interjections and expletives), such as <span class="ird">Avui</span>, ‘Damn it!’ [ʔɐˈʋuɪ̯ʔ], <span class="ird">pšehui</span>,
  ‘annoying’ [ˈpɕɛxuɪ̯ʔ] and <span class="ird">Oi</span>, ‘Hey!’ [ʔɔɪ̯ʔ]. Even then, /uɪ̯/, and less commonly, /ɔɪ̯/ may be realized as [yː] or [iː] (the latter is more common in souther dialects and the former elsewhere).
<p>In most dialects the diphthong /eɪ̯/ has almost completely merged with é
/eː/, although some divergent dialects in the south may realise the diphthong
as [iː] (e.g., neite, ‘word’ /ˈneɪ̯tɛ/ but realised as [ˈneːtɛ] or [ˈɲiːtɛ]).


<h2>Consonants</h2>

<h3>Plosives</h3>
2.3.1 Plosives
Initial velar stops are affricated when following a pause, so that the pair /k ɡ/
is often realised as [k͡x ɡ͡ɣ]. Some Southeastern dialects, however, normally
realise initial velar stops as aspirated [kʰ ɡʰ] instead. This sound change can
be traced to the initial aspirated stops *kʰ, *gʰ, *tʰ, and *dʰ in Old Iridian
weakening to affricates. The labial stops /p b/ are unaffected by this process
as most instances of *pʰ and *bʰ have merged to /b/ or /ʋ/ in modern Iridian.
The velar stops /k ɡ/ are lenited to the velar fricatives [x ɣ] intervocalically,
before a voiceless stop, after a vocalised l if followed by another vowel or a
voiceless stop, or before the nasal consonants /n/ or /m/ if following a vowel
immediately. This lenition also occurs word-finally unless followed by a voiced
