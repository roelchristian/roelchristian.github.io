<h1>Number</h1>

{% include under-construction.html %}

Nouns in Iridian are not formally marked for number. Thus the word byl,
for example, can mean either ‘child’ or ‘children’ depending on the context.
The same form is used when the noun is preceded by a numeral.

<blockquote>
  <div class="gloss-block">
    <div class="unit"><p class="ird">hroná</p><p class="en">three</p></div>
    <div class="unit"><p class="ird">byl</p><p class="en">child</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="gloss-block-trl">
    ‘three children’
  </div>
</blockquote>

Nevertheless, Iridian can express semantic plurality by using quantifiers,
numerals, pluralizing particles or even through context alone. One such
particle is ně. Ně is a proclitic and attaches to the left-most part of the noun
phrase or the verb phrase it modifies.
