<h2>Politeness and forms of address</h2>

  <p>Although not as complex and as pervasive as the politeness/formality system
  found in Japanese or Korean, Iridian formally encodes more sociolinguistic
  information than its neigbouring languages such as Czech or Hungarian.</p>
  
  <p>Broadly speaking, Iridian distinguishes between three levels of speech:
  (1) polite speech, which serves more or less as the “default” level of politeness,
  as this is the speech level most often used by, say, strangers when talking to
  each other; (2) formal speech, which is used in more formal settings, where
  the speaker wants to distance themself from the listener or explicitly signal
  their politeness, such as in a conversation among business associates or when
  talking to a divinity; and (3) casual speech, which is used between close friends
  and family members, or to or among children. These levels of speech are not
  definite, of course, and politeness is more properly viewed as a spectrum
  (cf., e.g., Hanson 2018) as speakers would often switch from one level of
  speech to another even when speaking to the same person, or within a single
  conversation.</p>

  <p>The distinction between politeness (which for the purpose of this grammar
  we can define as the psychological or social distance between speakers) on the
  one hand, and formality (which we can define as situational distance) on the
  other, is not always one made (or kept) in Iridian. Indeed, more often than
  not, these categories are often viewed by most speakers as essentially being the
  same. This is further complicated by the fact that the distinction between the
  various speech levels is not morphologically marked but is facilitated instead
  by the preference for certain constructions and forms of address.
  
  <p>The choice of which speech level to use with which speaker and in which
  scenarios is influenced by a lot of factors. It would be helpful, however, to
  analyse these factors as being influenced by two main considerations: the
  relationship—more specifically, the familiarity,—between the speakers, and
  the social setting in which the conversation or interaction is taking place.</p>
  
  <p>The first consideration, the relationship between speakers, divides the levels
  of speech into two groups: familiar speech, which consists of the casual
  speech level and distant speech which consists of both the formal and
  polite speech levels. This distinction is perhaps of greater actual importance
  than that introduced earlier between the levels of speech, as the differences
  between familiar speech and distant speech are more pronounced than the
  differences between formal speech and polite speech, which are often more
  subtler. Distant speech is characterized by a preference to indirect speech acts
  where possible. For example, direct imperatives or prohibitives are virtually</p>
