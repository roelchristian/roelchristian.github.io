<h1>Quotative constructions and evidentiality</h1>

{% include under-construction.html %}

Evidentiality is a grammatical category that is concered in the explicit encoding of a source of information or knowledge (i.e. evidence) which the
speaker claims to have made use of for producing the primary proposition of the utterance (Diewald and Smirnova 2010: 1-2). Iridian is unique among
languages of Central Europe (and of Europe in general) in possessing a grammaticalised evidentiality system. Even non-Indo European languages in the
region such as Hungarian (cf. author) or Basque (cf. Alcázar 2010) do not
possess an overt evidential. Of course a speaker’s source of information may
be expressed through other methods
