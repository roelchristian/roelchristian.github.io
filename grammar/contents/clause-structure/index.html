	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.
		
	<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
	or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
	or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
	topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
	topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
	sentence is structured.

	<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
	of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
	although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
	as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
	requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
	information afterwards.
		
	<div class="ex-cont">
	<ol class="example">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Martha saw John.</li>
				<li>A dog bit Martha.</li>
				<li>It is raining today.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><p>[Janek]<sub>Top</sub> [mlaza boulešik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Janek, he killed his brother.’</li>
				<li><p>[Tereza]<sub>Top</sub> [jecám nalečnik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog.’</li>
				<li><p>[Shléd]<sub>Top</sub> [zniepšalí.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for today, it is raining.’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

<p>More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb,
and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>Tereza jecám nalečnik.
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog’</li>
			<li><p>Jec Tereze nalčešik.
			<p>‘As for the dog, it bit Tereza.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>As Kiss (2004: 9) notes:
<blockquote>
	<p>We tend to describe events from a human perspective, as statements about their
	human participants – and subjects are more often [+human] than objects are. In the
	case of verbs with a [–human] subject and a [+human] accusative or oblique
	complement, the most common permutation is that in which the accusative or
	oblique complement occupies the topic position [.] When the possessor is the only
	human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]</p>

<h2 id="coordination">Coordination</h2>

<p>Iridian has three groups of coordinating conjunctions: the additive a, ‘and’
and še, ‘with’; the contrastive má and ozná (both translated to English as
‘but’); and the disjunctive/correlative je, le and ni.
A corresponds to the English ‘and.’ When coordinating simple noun pairs,
however, še, ‘i’s more often used though. The derived construction a še is also
common and has a similar meaning to the English ‘and also’.</p>

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">

	<div class="gloss-block">

		<div class="gloss-block-trl">
			<p>‘I heard Janek as well as Marek failed the class.’</p>
		</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>In constructions with še where one of the nouns coordinated is a pronoun
or a deictic, the pronoun or deictic is presented first followed by the other
noun in the instrumental case.</p>

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>

			<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Dá</p><p class="en"><span class="gloss">1s.str</span></p></div>

		<div class="gloss-block-trl">
			<p>‘Ivan and I are cousins.’</p>
		</div>
	</li>

</ol>
</div>

<p>In a few cases, a is used instead of še where the latter can be interpreted as
having an attributive meaning. Where the noun is marked, however, only a
	can be used.</p>

<h2 id="apposition">Apposition</h2>
<p>Appositive constructions in Iridian involve the juxtaposition of two or more
noun phrases that have a single referent. An apposition can be non-restrictive
if the appositive can be removed freely without changing the meaning of a
sentence, or restrictive otherwise.
  
<p>Formally both non-restrictive and restrictive appositives are treated as
modifier phrases but only the latter is grammaticalized. The restrictive appositive
must always precede the noun phrase it modifies, linked together by the particle <span class="ird">ko</span>.
Non-restrictive appositives on the other hand are simply juxtaposed
together, although a comma is often inserted around the appositive if it consists of more than one word.

</div>

<p>Examples(28a) and (28b) shows two different translations of the English
phrase ‘My brother Óto is studying in Munich.’ Example (28a) is nonrestrictive
and can be interpreted as ‘I have a brother namsed Óto who is
studying in Munich’ while (28b) being restrictive can be translated more on
the lines of ‘Among my brothers, it is Óto who is studying in Munich.’ The
restrictive appositive implies specificity and by extension the existence of a
group where this specificity holds true; in (28b) this is taken to mean that a
set of brothers exists and Óto is a member of this set.</p>

<p>The English appositive oblique, which uses an &lsquo;of&rsquo;-phrase with an
appositive meaning, is translated in Iridian without the particle <span class="ir">ko
</span>, even though it is restrictive in meaning.</p>

<h2 id="syntax-of-nominals">Syntax of event and participant nominals</h2>

<p>As we have established in § 3.9.2, Iridian has three forms of nominalisation:
(1) the mainly non-productive usage of the nominalising -ou with the verbal
stem to form resultant nominals; (2) the use of -ou in conjunction with the
gerund-forming prefix po(d)- to form a verbal noun (which we call an event
nominal or gerund) and which may either include the internal arguments
of the parent verb or not; and (3) the formation of a participant nominal
(cf. Pearson 2013) which nominalises not the event described by the verb but
its participants.</p>

<p>Since gerunds represent the nominalisation of the event described by the
verb, they are therefore inherently abstract and active in meaning. Since the
nominalised forms are abstract, it follows that they are also tenseless and
aspectless. Iridian gerunds, however, may be optionally marked for their
lexical aspect or aktionsart using the continuous aspect suffix -eví (which
subsequently becomes -ív- through sound change). It is important to note
though that although a marker for grammatical aspect is used, what is being
marked is lexical and not grammatical aspect; specifically, the addition of -ív-
only signifies that the action is iterative in nature and thus the gerund itself
remains tenseless and aspectless.</p>

<p>In CENs, both the agent and the patient are marked in the genitive.<label for="sn-serekaite"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-serekaite"
class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Šereikaitė (2020) argues that although (in the case of Lithuanian, at least) the
actor and the theme from the original sentence both become marked in the genitive in
the resulting complex event nominal, the superficially indentical genitives are actually
two distinct cases: a higher genitive (<span class="gloss">gen.h</span>) assigned to agents and possessors and
a lower genitive (<span class="gloss">gen.l</span>) assigned to grammatical objects. Although this argument is
interesting and probably holds true as well in Iridian CENs, we will not make an effort
to ascertain whether there is an actual difference in the two genitive cases in Iridian
as this is not needed for the purpose of this grammar.</span> If
both are present, the agent must always appear first. This construction is
quite common cross-linguistically, as we see in the examples below.</p>

<p>The use of the genitive to mark both the actor and the theme in the original
sentence is of course a recipe for ambiguity. When only one of either the actor
or the theme is present in the CEN, the ambiguity is on whether the noun
marked represents the one or the other, as, e.g., the phrase Jancě podohletou
which can be interpreted to mean either ‘the act of remembering Janek’ or
‘Janek’s act of remembering’ without any further information. A second
ambiguity arises when both the actor and the theme are in the sentence as it is
unclear, without any context, the genitive is actually being used to mark their
thematic role in the originally or is in fact a possessive. The same is true in, for
example, Lithuanian where as Šereikaitė (2020) points out, sentence (30b)
can also be alternatively translated as ‘[the] destruction of Jonas’s plants’.</p>
	
<p>The first type of ambiguity is resolved in English by using word order: in
general, a prepositive genitive (i.e., using the clitic ’s or the possessive form of
a pronoun) is used when the noun in the genitive case in the CEN represents
the actor (e.g., ‘John’s remembering’) while a postpositive genitive is used
when the noun in the genitive represents the theme (e.g., ‘the remembering
of John’). This in turn, can be extended to the second type, e.g., ‘John’s
remembering of Margaret’. However, the obligatorily head-final nature of
Iridian syntax means that such strategy is not possible. Instead, the strategy
used in Iridian is more similar to the one found in Tagalog where the theme
may be marked using the oblique sa<label for="sn-tagalog-sa"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tagalog-ng"
class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This becomes kay before proper nouns</span>

class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">To call ng (pronounced [nɐŋ])
as a genitive marker is simplistic (even erroneous)
but should be enough for the purpose of our discussion.</span>Thus we can
restate (30c) as follows:</p>

	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>An immediate consequence of replacing the genitive ng with the oblique
marker sa/kay is that the theme is now interpreted as definite (cf. Kaufman
2009: 3, 40). The use of the oblique to mark the theme can be used even
when only one element is present in the event nominal; in fact, when the
theme is known as definite for a fact (e.g., if it is a person), the choice between
the oblique and the genitive is what distinguishes the actor and the theme.
Thus we have</p>

<p>In Iridian, the a na clause corresponds to the Tagalog use of the oblique to
indicate a definite theme in a CEN.</p>

<section>
	<h2 id ="quotative">Quotative constructions and evidentiality</h2>
	<h3>Quotative construction in general</h3>
<p>Evidentiality is a grammatical category that is concered in the explicit
encoding of a source of information or knowledge (i.e. evidence) which the
speaker claims to have made use of for producing the primary proposition of
the utterance (Diewald and Smirnova 2010: 1-2). Iridian is unique among
languages of Central Europe (and of Europe in general) in possessing a
grammaticalised evidentiality system. Even non-Indo European languages in the
region such as Hungarian (cf. author) or Basque (cf. Alcázar 2010) do not
possess an overt evidential. Of course a speaker’s source of information may
be expressed through other methods
The Iridian evidentiality system more or less falls under Aikhenvald’s (2004)
A3 category, where the distinction is between the marked quotative form for
reported speech/hearsay and the unmarked ‘everything else’ category which
is evidentiality-neutral.</p>
	
<h3>Quotative constructions and reported speech</h3>
<p>The principal use of the quotative is to explicitly mark reported speech. The
	reported clause is separated from the rest of the sentence by the particleto-že.</p>

<p>The particle to-že is in fact made up of two separate clitics: the particle to
which is used to mark relative clauses, and -že which is the primary quotative
particle. This is made more evident in nested quotations, where -že can only
be attached to the rightmost reported clause:</p>

<p>The use of pronouns in quoted clauses is similar to English, with the main
exception being the use of the reflexive se if the subject of the quoted clause is
the same as the subject of the main clause. This is true even if the subject of
the main clause is a pronoun.</p>

<p>The verb zěká, ‘to say’ is called a verbum dicendi from the Latin meaning
‘verb of speech/speaking.’ Other verba dicendi in Iridian include vadá, ‘to
think’; kvuštá, ‘to hear’; vidá, ‘to see’; hloupá, ‘to ask’; ohletá, ‘to remember’;
sehová, ‘to recount, to tell a story’. Note that although they are called verbs
“of speaking” they do not necessarily introduce speech as much as function as
grammaticalized tags marking the quotative, which is more properly analyzed
to mark not just speech but inferentiality and evidentiality as well.</p>

<p>More complex verba dicendi can be formed by using an imperfect converbial construction
(the converb form in -ěc) with a canonical verbum dicendi.
To illustrate this consider the following sentences in English:</p>
	
<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>She said no.</li>
			<li>She whispered no.</li>
			<li>She said no in a whisper.</li>
			<li>?She said in a whisper no.</li>
			<li>??She said whisperingly no.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>We see that both said (46a) andwhispered (46b) are verba dicendi in English.
Nonetheless it’s also obvious how 46b is simply a function of (46a), i.e., we can
express (46b) in terms of (46a), in this case using an adverbial construction
(‘in a whisper’) as we see in 46c or the more affected 46d. Finally using a
simple adverbial is theoretically allowed in English (46e), although as we see
the resulting construction is rather unwieldy or unnatural-sounding.</p>
	
<p>In Iridian, however, constructions like (46b) are not permitted, with preference given to adverbial (or more correctly, converbial) constructions. Thus
we translate (46b) as:</p>

<p>It should be noted as well how the verb vadá, ‘to think’ and its derived
forms, due to their inherent meanings, require the subjunctive to be used in
the reported clause. This is true whether or not the subjunctive would have
been used had the reported clause been a regular dependent clause.</p>
	
<p>We see from that when it comes to reported speech and similar constructions
in Iridian, the verbum dicendi is not necessary to create a well-formed
sentence. The same is true with the quotative particleto-že. Both can be omitted
without making the sentence grammatically incorrect since the quotative
particle is enough to identify the reported clause.</p>
	
<p>In most instances, however, removing either the main verb or the main verb
and the quotative particle can cause the resulting sentence to acquire a new
meaning. This is especially true when the quotative mood is used not to report
speech but to imply a certain unsureness on the part of the speaker about
the information being presented, or for the speaker to distance themself by
implying through the use of the quotative that the information is secondhand
and not theirs. Generally to-že is kept when the speaker is quoting themself,
to repeat or emphasize what they have said, or expletively, to express their
frustration or affirmation.</p>
	
<p>Interestingly, commands and requests are not treated as reported speech
but as regular subordinate clauses governed by to and not by to-že.</p>
	
<p>When the quoted clause is a question, whether a direct one or not, the
quoted clause is preceded by the particle a, ‘and’ and the word ane, ‘whether’
is used instead of to-že. The word ane is also used for verba dicendi that are
interrogative in nature, such as préhoustá, ‘to ask’,</p>
	
	<h3>Bare quotatives and clause linking</h3>
	
<p>Quoted clauses in Iridian may also appear without an overt predicate, as
well as without being signalled by the quotative particle to-že. We will call
this construction a bare quotative after the terminology in Tomioka and
Kim (2019) in reference to embedded quotative constructions in Japanese
and Korean without overt predicates. The term as originally used by these
authors refer only to embedded quotatives in Japanese and Korean, but we
will be using it to refer to both an unselected (i.e., predicateless) quotative in
a subordinate clause (which we will call syntactic) and in the main clause
(which we will call semantic).</p>
	
<p>The choice to call the second type a semantic bare quotative is motivated
by the fact that an unselected quotative in the main clause is often used not
to mark a speech act but to indicate the epistemic value of (viz., to pass the
speaker’s judgement on) a proposition. Nevertheless, we can still see it used
as a true quotative, as when the omission of the predicate or the quotative
particle is through mere ellipsis.</p>
	
<p>The first type, on the other hand, is mostly used as a clause-linking strategy.
The quotative construction is still considered as a speech act, but, like
converbial constructions or še clauses, the relationship between the main clause
and the reported clause becomes interpreted as being one of causality, or at
least of dependency, although of course this causality or dependency is only
indirect, as we see in the examples below, where the embedded quotative and
the simple še clause present to different interpretations.</p>


<h3>Epistemic extensions</h3>

<p>As in most other languages with an overt evidential system, the Iridian quotative
has secondary epistemic extensions. This may be realised either by using
the quotative by itself or through auxiliary epistemic markers. As we have
established in the previous sections, the quotative can be used by a speaker
both to distance themself from the statement on the one hand and to assert
their belief in its truthfulness on the other; the use of a secondary epistemic
marker eliminates this possible confusion in what would otherwise have been
a contradictory usage of the same grammatical category. These auxiliary particles
nonetheless, may of course be left out in discourse if the speaker thinks
the epistemic usage of the quotative is clear enough from the context.</p>

<p>A speaker’s judgement of the truthfulness of a statement may be made clear
by the dubitative bude or the affirmative toleto. When using the quotative to
quote oneself, bude expresses a disbelief predicated upon surprise rather than
on a judgement of a statement’s veracity; used the same way, toleto acquires a
secondary meaning of insistence, even annoyance.</p>

<p>A speaker’s uncertainty may also be expressed using the quotative even
when the statement directly came from the speaker. The uncertainty may
refer to both the factuality of the statement or to its source. This strategy is
used to signal the speaker’s emotional or cognitive distance from the event.
This may be further complemented by the particle iz which we will glossing
here as rep for reportative but only for the sake of convenience, in order
to distinguish the various auxiliary particles we have introduced here, as the
“reportative” does not exist as a true grammatical category in Iridian for our
purposes. Iz implies a greater degree of disjunction between the speaker and
the statement than the plain quotative. Although it does not pass a judgement
on the truth value of the statement as do dube or toleto, iz makes it clear that
the statement did not come from the speaker and that the responsibility for
the statement does not lie on them. Iz is particularly common in newscasts or
in other formal settings where the speaker is communicating statements from
another speaker or group and the identity of the speaker or group has already
been established earlier in the conversation and is thus known to everyone.</p>

<p>Uncertainty on the truthfulness of the statement may also be expressed
using the inferential particles bylo and atole. Whereas iz raises the question of
the character of the source and is neutral as to the speaker’s commitment to
it (although one can be understood simply by pointing out the fact that the
source is something other than oneself to be effectively passing judgement)
both bylo and atole reflect the speaker’s judgement. Bylo in general is used
when the proposition is coming from the speaker themself while atole is
used when the speaker thinks that the statement can be inferred from the
surrounding facts.</p>

<h2 id="rel-comp-const">Comparative constructions</h2>

<p>The clitic <span class="ir">tám</span> is used to form simple comparative and relative constructions.
<span class="ir">Tám</span> is often ommitted where the comparison can be implied from context. In
this construction, the standard of comparison (the noun preceded by ‘than’ in
English) is unmarked and the noun being compared marked in the agentive if
it is a positive/negative comparison, or in the instrumental if it is a correlation.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janek(-tám)</p><p class="en">Janek</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Markám</p><p class="en">Marek-<span class="gloss">agt</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestaževí.</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">cont</span></p></div>
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		<p>‘Marek is taller than Janek.’</p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janek(-tám)</p><p class="en">Janek</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Marku</p><p class="en">Marek-<span class="gloss">ins</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestaževí.</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">cont</span></p></div>
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		<p>‘Marek is as tall as Janek.’</p>
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Note that <span class="ir">tám</span> can only be used with the copulative form of the stative verb,
as the attributive and nominal forms have separate conjugated comparative
forms. When using these forms, however, the standard of comparison is
marked in the genitive. In relative constructions, the instrumental is also
replaced with the genitive, but the modifier <span class="ir">zní</span>, ‘same’ is added before the
stative verb.</p>

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janc&iacute;</p><p class="en">Janek-<span class="gloss">gen</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestažení</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">comp-att</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">hloc</p><p class="en">boy</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">mlazka.</p><p class="en">brother-<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>
		
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		<p>‘The boy who is taller than Janek is my brother.’</p><label for="sn-translation-rel-comp" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-translation-rel-comp" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Literally, ‘The taller-than-Janek boy is my brother.’</span></p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janc&iacute;</p><p class="en">Janek-<span class="gloss">gen</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">zn&iacute;</p><p class="en">same</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestažení</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">comp-att</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">hloc</p><p class="en">boy</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">mlazka.</p><p class="en">brother-<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		<p>‘The boy who is as tall as Janek is my brother.’</p>
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><span class="ir">Tám</span> can be relativized by appending the clitic to. When used with tám-to
the standard of comparison is marked in the patientive case. The use of tám-to
in relative clauses is discussed in further detail in the next chapter.</p>
