	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.
		
	<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
	or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
	or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
	topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
	topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
	sentence is structured.

	<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
	of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
	although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
	as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
	requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
	information afterwards.
		
	<div class="ex-cont">
	<ol class="example">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Martha saw John.</li>
				<li>A dog bit Martha.</li>
				<li>It is raining today.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><p>[Janek]<sub>Top</sub> [mlaza boulešik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Janek, he killed his brother.’</li>
				<li><p>[Tereza]<sub>Top</sub> [jecám nalečnik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog.’</li>
				<li><p>[Shléd]<sub>Top</sub> [zniepšalí.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for today, it is raining.’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

<p>More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb,
and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>Tereza jecám nalečnik.
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog’</li>
			<li><p>Jec Tereze nalčešik.
			<p>‘As for the dog, it bit Tereza.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>As Kiss (2004: 9) notes:
<blockquote>
We tend to describe eventsfrom a human perspective, as statements
about theirhuman participants – and subjects are more often [+human]
  than objects are. Inthe case of verbs with a [–human] subject
and a [+human] accusative or obliquecomplement, the most common permutation is that in which the accusative oroblique complement occupies the topic position [.] When the possessor is theonly
  human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]</blockquote>

<h2 id="rel-comp-const">Relative and comparative constructions</h2>

<p>The clitic <span class="ird">tám</span> is used to form simple comparative and relative constructions.
<span class="ird">Tám</span> is often ommitted where the comparison can be implied from context. In
this construction, the standard of comparison (the noun preceded by ‘than’ in
English) is unmarked and the noun being compared marked in the agentive if
it is a positive/negative comparison, or in the instrumental if it is a correlation.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janek(-tám)</p><p class="en">Janek</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Markám</p><p class="en">Marek-<span class="gloss">agt</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestaževí.</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">cont</span></p></div>
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘Marek is taller than Janek.’
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janek(-tám)</p><p class="en">Janek</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Marku</p><p class="en">Marek-<span class="gloss">ins</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestaževí.</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">cont</span></p></div>
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘Marek is as tall as Janek.’
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

Note that <span class="ird">tám</span> can only be used with the copulative form of the stative verb,
as the attributive and nominal forms have separate conjugated comparative
forms. When using these forms, however, the standard of comparison is
marked in the genitive. In relative constructions, the instrumental is also
replaced with the genitive, but the modifier <span class="ird">zní</span>, ‘same’ is added before the
stative verb.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janc&iacute;</p><p class="en">Janek-<span class="gloss">gen</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestažení</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">comp-att</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">hloc</p><p class="en">boy</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">mlazka.</p><p class="en">brother-<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>
		
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘The boy who is taller than Janek is my brother’ (Lit., ‘The taller-than-Janek boy is my brother.’)
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janc&iacute;</p><p class="en">Janek-<span class="gloss">gen</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">zn&iacute;</p><p class="en">same</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestažení</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">comp-att</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">hloc</p><p class="en">boy</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">mlazka.</p><p class="en">brother-<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>
		
	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘The boy who is as tall as Janek is my brother.’
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><span class="ird">Tám</span> can be relativized by appending the clitic to. When used with tám-to
the standard of comparison is marked in the patientive case. The use of tám-to
in relative clauses is discussed in further detail in the next chapter.
