<h1> Clause structure</h1>

{% include under-construction.html %}

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
verb should appear at the end of a sentence.

<h2 id="topic-pred">Topic-predicate constructions</h2>
<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
sentence is structured.

<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
information afterwards.
<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Martha saw John.</li>
			<li>A dog bit Martha.</li>
			<li>It is raining today.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>[Janek]<sub>Top</sub> [mlaza boulešik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
			<p>‘As for Janek, he killed his brother.’</li>
			<li><p>[Tereza]<sub>Top</sub> [jecám nalečnik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog.’</li>
			<li><p>[Shléd]<sub>Top</sub> [zniepšalí.]<sub>Pred</sub>
			<p>‘As for today, it is raining.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb,
and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>Tereza jecám nalečnik.
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog’</li>
			<li><p>Jec Tereze nalčešik.
			<p>‘As for the dog, it bit Tereza.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>As Kiss (2004: 9) notes:
<blockquote>
We tend to describe eventsfrom a human perspective, as statements
about theirhuman participants – and subjects are more often [+human]
  than objects are. Inthe case of verbs with a [–human] subject
and a [+human] accusative or obliquecomplement, the most common permutation is that in which the accusative oroblique complement occupies the topic position [.] When the possessor is theonly
  human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]</blockquote>

<h2>Coordination</h2>
Iridian has three groups of coordinating conjunctions: the additive a, ‘and’
and še, ‘with’; the contrastive má and ozná (both translated to English as
‘but’); and the disjunctive/correlative je, le and ni.
A corresponds to the English ‘and.’ When coordinating simple noun pairs,
however, še, ‘i’s more often used though. The derived construction a še is also
common and has a similar meaning to the English ‘and also’.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Mámka</p><p class="en">mother<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>

	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘Mom and Dad went to Prague for vacation.’

	</li>
	
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">

		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">hlupinžice.</p><p class="en">fail-<span class="gloss">av-pf-qt</span></p></div>

	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘Janek as well as Marek failed the class.’
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>In constructions with še where one of the nouns coordinated is a pronoun
or a deictic, the pronoun or deictic is presented first followed by the other
noun in the instrumental case.
	
(12) Dá
1s.str
še
com
Ivanu
Ivan-ins
sohladoušce.
classmate
‘Ivan and I are classmates.’
<p>In a few cases, a is used instead of še where the latter can be interpreted as
having an attributive meaning. Where the noun is marked, however, only a
can be used.
(13) a. trava
bread
še
com
lépu
cheese-ins
‘bread with cheese’ i.e., ‘cheese
sandwich’
b. trava
bread
a
and
lép
cheese
‘bread and cheese’
(14) To
this
kurs-te
class-foc
Jankám

a
and

Marek-agt
hlupienince.
class
‘It was this class that Marek and Janek failed.’
The bisyndetic coordination (Velupillai 2012) a Y a Y is also with similar
emphatic meaning as a še.

<h2 id="apposition">Apposition</h2>
<p>Appositive constructions in Iridian involve the juxtaposition of two or more
noun phrases that have a single referent. An apposition can be non-restrictive
if the appositive can be removed freely without changing the meaning of a
sentence, or restrictive otherwise.
  
<p>Formally both non-restrictive and restrictive appositives are treated as modifier phrases but only the latter is grammaticalized. The restrictive appositive
must always precede the noun phrase it modifies, linked together by the particle ko. Non-restrictive appositives on the other hand are simply juxtaposed
together, although a comma is often inserted around the appositive if it consists of more than one word.

<p>Examples(28a) and (28b) shows two different translations of the English
phrase ‘My brother Óto is studying in Munich.’ Example (28a) is nonrestrictive and can be interpreted as ‘I have a brother namsed Óto who is
studying in Munich’ while (28b) being restrictive can be translated more on
the lines of ‘Among my brothers, it is Óto who is studying in Munich.’ The
restrictive appositive implies specificity and by extension the existence of a
group where this specificity holds true; in (28b) this is taken to mean that a
set of brothers exists and Óto is a member of this set.

<h2 id="event-part-nom">Syntax of event and participant nominals</h2>
As we have established in § 3.9.2, Iridian has three forms of nominalisation:
(1) the mainly non-productive usage of the nominalising -ou with the verbal
stem to form resultant nominals; (2) the use of -ou in conjunction with the
gerund-forming prefix po(d)- to form a verbal noun (which we call an event
nominal or gerund) and which may either include the internal arguments
of the parent verb or not; and (3) the formation of a participant nominal
(cf. Pearson 2013) which nominalises not the event described by the verb but
its participants.

<h2 id="quot"> Quotative constructions and evidentiality</h2>
<h3>Quotative construction in general</h3>
evidentiality is a grammatical category that is concered in the explicit
encoding of a source of information or knowledge (i.e. evidence) which the
speaker claims to have made use of for producing the primary proposition of
the utterance (Diewald and Smirnova 2010: 1-2). Iridian is unique among
languages of Central Europe (and of Europe in general) in possessing a grammaticalised evidentiality system. Even non-Indo European languages in the
region such as Hungarian (cf. author) or Basque (cf. Alcázar 2010) do not
possess an overt evidential. Of course a speaker’s source of information may
be expressed through other methods
The Iridian evidentiality system more or less falls under Aikhenvald’s (2004)
A3 category, where the distinction is between the marked quotative form for
eported speech/hearsay and the unmarked ‘everything else’ category which
is evidentiality-neutral
7.12.2 Quotative constructions and reported speech
The principal use of the quotative is to explicitly mark reported speech. The
reported clause is separated from the rest of the sentence by the particleto-že.

(42) Koleč
key
sní
refl.acc
upolšice
refl-lose-av-pf-qt
to-že
rel=qt (:=qp)
Lukáš
Lukáš
žiček.
say-av-pf
‘Lukáš said he lost his keys.’
The particle to-že is in fact made up of two separate clitics: the particle to
which is used to mark relative clauses, and -že which is the primary quotative
particle. This is made more evident in nested quotations, where -že can only
be attached to the rightmost reported clause:
(43) Dá
1sg
dněm
dem.agt
vednice
see-pv-pf-qt
to
rel
Marek
Marek
žičice
say-av-pf-qt
to-že
qp
Lukáš
Lukáš
žiček.
say-av-pf
‘Lukáš said Marek said he (Marek) saw me.’
Direct quotations do not require the quotative, although they are still
separated from the main clause by to-že.
(44) „Dá
1sg
záščenžit”
neg-come-av-sup.p
to-že
qp
žiček.
say-av-pf
‘“I won’t be coming,” (he) said.’
The use of pronouns in quoted clauses is similar to English, with the main
exception being the use of the reflexive se if the subject of the quoted clause is
the same as the subject of the main clause. This is true even if the subject of
the main clause is a pronoun.
(45) Se

neg-come-av-sup.p-qt
to-že
qp
Marek
Marek
(dá)
1sg
žiček.
say-av-pf
‘Marek/I said he/I won’t be coming to the party tonight.’

The verb zěká, ‘to say’ is called a verbum dicendi from the Latin meaning
‘verb of speech/speaking.’ Other verba dicendi in Iridian include vadá, ‘to
think’; kvuštá, ‘to hear’; vidá, ‘to see’; hloupá, ‘to ask’; ohletá, ‘to remember’;
sehová, ‘to recount, to tell a story’. Note that although they are called verbs
“of speaking” they do not necessarily introduce speech as much as function as
grammaticalized tags marking the quotative, which is more properly analyzed
to mark not just speech but inferentiality and evidentiality as well.
More complex verba dicendi can be formed by using an imperfect converbial construction (the converb form in -ěc) with a canonical verbum dicendi.
To illustrate this consider the following sentences in English:
(46) a. She said no.
b. She whispered no.
c. She said no in a whisper.
d. ?She said in a whisper no.
e. ??She said whisperingly no.
We see that both said (46a) andwhispered (46b) are verba dicendi in English.
Nonetheless it’s also obvious how 46b is simply a function of (46a), i.e., we can
express (46b) in terms of (46a), in this case using an adverbial construction
(‘in a whisper’) as we see in 46c or the more affected 46d. Finally using a
simple adverbial is theoretically allowed in English (46e), although as we see
the resulting construction is rather unwieldy or unnatural-sounding.
In Iridian, however, constructions like (46b) are not permitted, with preference given to adverbial (or more correctly, converbial) constructions. Thus
we translate (46b) as:
(47) Ne
no
to-že
qp
mišlec
whisper-cv
zíček.
say-av-pf
‘(She) whispered no.’
It should be noted as well how the verb vadá, ‘to think’ and its derived
forms, due to their inherent meanings, require the subjunctive to be used in
the reported clause. This is true whether or not the subjunctive would have
been used had the reported clause been a regular dependent clause.
(48) Já
you
mnou
correct
nehlí
cop.sbj.qt
to-že
qp
Martin
Martin
spouvěc
agree-cv.ipf
váževí.
think-av-cont
‘Martin agrees that you are right.

We see from that when it comes to reported speech and similar constructions in Iridian, the verbum dicendi is not necessary to create a well-formed
sentence. The same is true with the quotative particleto-že. Both can be omitted without making the sentence grammatically incorrect since the quotative
particle is enough to identify the reported clause..
In most instances, however, removing either the main verb or the main verb
and the quotative particle can cause the resulting sentence to acquire a new
meaning. This is especially true when the quotative mood is used not to report
speech but to imply a certain unsureness on the part of the speaker about
the information being presented, or for the speaker to distance themself by
implying through the use of the quotative that the information is secondhand
and not theirs. Generally to-že is kept when the speaker is quoting themself,
to repeat or emphasize what they have said, or expletively, to express their
frustration or affirmation.
Interestingly, commands and requests are not treated as reported speech
but as regular subordinate clauses governed by to and not by to-že.
When the quoted clause is a question, whether a direct one or not, the
quoted clause is preceded by the particle a, ‘and’ and the word ane, ‘whether’
is used instead of to-že. The word ane is also used for verba dicendi that are
interrogative in nature, such as préhoustá, ‘to ask’,
(49) A

Janek

‘His fans are excited to know if he’ll finish his book this year. ’
The quotative is also triggered by phrases introduced with ty, ‘according
to’ or záty, ‘contrary to,’ with the latter requiring the subjunctive.
(51) Messi

<h3>Bare quotatives and clause linking</h3>
<p>Quoted clauses in Iridian may also appear without an overt predicate, as
well as without being signalled by the quotative particle to-že. We will call
this construction a bare quotative after the terminology in Tomioka and
Kim (2019) in reference to embedded quotative constructions in Japanese
and Korean without overt predicates. The term as originally used by these
authors refer only to embedded quotatives in Japanese and Korean, but we
will be using it to refer to both an unselected (i.e., predicateless) quotative in
a subordinate clause (which we will call syntactic) and in the main clause
(which we will call semantic).

<p>The choice to call the second type a semantic bare quotative is motivated
by the fact that an unselected quotative in the main clause is often used not
to mark a speech act but to indicate the epistemic value of (viz., to pass the
speaker’s judgement on) a proposition. Nevertheless, we can still see it used
as a true quotative, as when the omission of the predicate or the quotative
particle is through mere ellipsis.

<p>The first type, on the other hand, is mostly used as a clause-linking strategy.
The quotative construction is still considered as a speech act, but, like converbial
constructions or še clauses, the relationship between the main clause
and the reported clause becomes interpreted as being one of causality, or at
least of dependency, although of course this causality or dependency is only
indirect, as we see in the examples below, where the embedded quotative and
the simple še clause present to different interpretations.

<h3>Epistemic extensions</h3>
<p>As in most other languages with an overt evidential system, the Iridian quotative has secondary epistemic extensions. This may be realised either by using
the quotative by itself or through auxiliary epistemic markers. As we have
established in the previous sections, the quotative can be used by a speaker
both to distance themself from the statement on the one hand and to assert
their belief in its truthfulness on the other; the use of a secondary epistemic
marker eliminates this possible confusion in what would otherwise have been
a contradictory usage of the same grammatical category. These auxiliary particles, nonetheless, may of course be left out in discourse if the speaker thinks
the epistemic usage of the quotative is clear enough from the context.

<p>A speaker’s judgement of the truthfulness of a statement may be made clear
by the dubitative bude or the affirmative toleto. When using the quotative to
quote oneself, bude expresses a disbelief predicated upon surprise rather than
on a judgement of a statement’s veracity; used the same way, toleto acquires a
secondary meaning of insistence, even annoyance.
