	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.

	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.
		
	<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
	or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
	or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
	topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
	topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
	sentence is structured.

	<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
	of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
	although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
	as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
	requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
	information afterwards.
