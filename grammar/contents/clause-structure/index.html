	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.
		
	<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
	or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
	or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
	topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
	topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
	sentence is structured.

	<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
	of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
	although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
	as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
	requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
	information afterwards.
		
	<div class="ex-cont">
	<ol class="example">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Martha saw John.</li>
				<li>A dog bit Martha.</li>
				<li>It is raining today.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><p>[Janek]<sub>Top</sub> [mlaza boulešik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Janek, he killed his brother.’</li>
				<li><p>[Tereza]<sub>Top</sub> [jecám nalečnik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog.’</li>
				<li><p>[Shléd]<sub>Top</sub> [zniepšalí.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for today, it is raining.’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

<p>More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb,
and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>Tereza jecám nalečnik.
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog’</li>
			<li><p>Jec Tereze nalčešik.
			<p>‘As for the dog, it bit Tereza.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>As Kiss (2004: 9) notes:
<blockquote>
	<p>We tend to describe events from a human perspective, as statements about their
	human participants – and subjects are more often [+human] than objects are. In the
	case of verbs with a [–human] subject and a [+human] accusative or oblique
	complement, the most common permutation is that in which the accusative or
	oblique complement occupies the topic position [.] When the possessor is the only
	human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]</p>

<h2 id="coordination">Coordination</h2>

<p>Iridian has three groups of coordinating conjunctions: the additive a, ‘and’
and še, ‘with’; the contrastive má and ozná (both translated to English as
‘but’); and the disjunctive/correlative je, le and ni.
A corresponds to the English ‘and.’ When coordinating simple noun pairs,
however, še, ‘i’s more often used though. The derived construction a še is also
common and has a similar meaning to the English ‘and also’.</p>

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
			<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Mámka</p><p class="en">mother<span class="gloss">-dim</span></p></div>

		</div>
		<div class="gloss-block-trl">
			<p>‘I heard Janek as well as Marek failed the class.’</p>
		</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>In constructions with še where one of the nouns coordinated is a pronoun
or a deictic, the pronoun or deictic is presented first followed by the other
noun in the instrumental case.</p>

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
			<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Dá</p><p class="en"><span class="gloss">1s.str</span></p></div>

		</div>
		<div class="gloss-block-trl">
			<p>‘Ivan and I are cousins.’</p>
		</div>
	</li>

</ol>
</div>

<p>In a few cases, a is used instead of še where the latter can be interpreted as
having an attributive meaning. Where the noun is marked, however, only a
	can be used.</p>

<section>

<h2 id="apposition">Apposition</h2>
<p>Appositive constructions in Iridian involve the juxtaposition of two or more
noun phrases that have a single referent. An apposition can be non-restrictive
if the appositive can be removed freely without changing the meaning of a
sentence, or restrictive otherwise.
  
<p>Formally both non-restrictive and restrictive appositives are treated as
modifier phrases but only the latter is grammaticalized. The restrictive appositive
must always precede the noun phrase it modifies, linked together by the particle <span class="ird">ko</span>.
Non-restrictive appositives on the other hand are simply juxtaposed
together, although a comma is often inserted around the appositive if it consists of more than one word.

<p>Examples(28a) and (28b) shows two different translations of the English
phrase ‘My brother Óto is studying in Munich.’ Example (28a) is nonrestrictive
and can be interpreted as ‘I have a brother namsed Óto who is
studying in Munich’ while (28b) being restrictive can be translated more on
the lines of ‘Among my brothers, it is Óto who is studying in Munich.’ The
restrictive appositive implies specificity and by extension the existence of a
group where this specificity holds true; in (28b) this is taken to mean that a
set of brothers exists and Óto is a member of this set.

<h2 id="syntax-of-nominals">Syntax of event and participant nominals</h2>

<p>As we have established in § 3.9.2, Iridian has three forms of nominalisation:
(1) the mainly non-productive usage of the nominalising -ou with the verbal
stem to form resultant nominals; (2) the use of -ou in conjunction with the
gerund-forming prefix po(d)- to form a verbal noun (which we call an event
nominal or gerund) and which may either include the internal arguments
of the parent verb or not; and (3) the formation of a participant nominal
(cf. Pearson 2013) which nominalises not the event described by the verb but
its participants.</p>

<p>Since gerunds represent the nominalisation of the event described by the
verb, they are therefore inherently abstract and active in meaning. Since the
nominalised forms are abstract, it follows that they are also tenseless and
aspectless. Iridian gerunds, however, may be optionally marked for their
lexical aspect or aktionsart using the continuous aspect suffix -eví (which
subsequently becomes -ív- through sound change). It is important to note
though that although a marker for grammatical aspect is used, what is being
marked is lexical and not grammatical aspect; specifically, the addition of -ív-
only signifies that the action is iterative in nature and thus the gerund itself
remains tenseless and aspectless.</p>

<p>In CENs, both the agent and the patient are marked in the genitive.<label for="sn-serekaite"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-serekaite"
class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Šereikaitė (2020) argues that although (in the case of Lithuanian, at least) the
actor and the theme from the original sentence both become marked in the genitive in
the resulting complex event nominal, the superficially indentical genitives are actually
two distinct cases: a higher genitive (<span class="gloss">gen.h</span>) assigned to agents and possessors and
a lower genitive (<span class="gloss">gen.l</span>) assigned to grammatical objects. Although this argument is
interesting and probably holds true as well in Iridian CENs, we will not make an effort
to ascertain whether there is an actual difference in the two genitive cases in Iridian
as this is not needed for the purpose of this grammar.</span> If
both are present, the agent must always appear first. This construction is
quite common cross-linguistically, as we see in the examples below.</p>

<p>The use of the genitive to mark both the actor and the theme in the original
sentence is of course a recipe for ambiguity. When only one of either the actor
or the theme is present in the CEN, the ambiguity is on whether the noun
marked represents the one or the other, as, e.g., the phrase Jancě podohletou
which can be interpreted to mean either ‘the act of remembering Janek’ or
‘Janek’s act of remembering’ without any further information. A second
ambiguity arises when both the actor and the theme are in the sentence as it is
unclear, without any context, the genitive is actually being used to mark their
thematic role in the originally or is in fact a possessive. The same is true in, for
example, Lithuanian where as Šereikaitė (2020) points out, sentence (30b)
can also be alternatively translated as ‘[the] destruction of Jonas’s plants’.</p>
	
<p>The first type of ambiguity is resolved in English by using word order: in
general, a prepositive genitive (i.e., using the clitic ’s or the possessive form of
a pronoun) is used when the noun in the genitive case in the CEN represents
the actor (e.g., ‘John’s remembering’) while a postpositive genitive is used
when the noun in the genitive represents the theme (e.g., ‘the remembering
of John’). This in turn, can be extended to the second type, e.g., ‘John’s
remembering of Margaret’. However, the obligatorily head-final nature of
Iridian syntax means that such strategy is not possible. Instead, the strategy
used in Iridian is more similar to the one found in Tagalog where the theme
may be marked using the oblique sa<label for="sn-tagalog-sa"
class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tagalog-ng"
class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This becomes kay before proper nouns</span>

class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">To call ng (pronounced [nɐŋ])
as a genitive marker is simplistic (even erroneous)
but should be enough for the purpose of our discussion.</span>Thus we can
restate (30c) as follows:</p>

		</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>An immediate consequence of replacing the genitive ng with the oblique
marker sa/kay is that the theme is now interpreted as definite (cf. Kaufman
2009: 3, 40). The use of the oblique to mark the theme can be used even
when only one element is present in the event nominal; in fact, when the
theme is known as definite for a fact (e.g., if it is a person), the choice between
the oblique and the genitive is what distinguishes the actor and the theme.
Thus we have</p>

<p>In Iridian, the a na clause corresponds to the Tagalog use of the oblique to
indicate a definite theme in a CEN.</p>

	<h2 id ="quotative">Quotative constructions and evidentiality</h2>
	<h3>Quotative construction in general</h3>
<p>Evidentiality is a grammatical category that is concered in the explicit
encoding of a source of information or knowledge (i.e. evidence) which the
speaker claims to have made use of for producing the primary proposition of
the utterance (Diewald and Smirnova 2010: 1-2). Iridian is unique among
languages of Central Europe (and of Europe in general) in possessing a
grammaticalised evidentiality system. Even non-Indo European languages in the
region such as Hungarian (cf. author) or Basque (cf. Alcázar 2010) do not
possess an overt evidential. Of course a speaker’s source of information may
be expressed through other methods
The Iridian evidentiality system more or less falls under Aikhenvald’s (2004)
A3 category, where the distinction is between the marked quotative form for
reported speech/hearsay and the unmarked ‘everything else’ category which
is evidentiality-neutral.</p>
	
<h3>Quotative constructions and reported speech</h3>
<p>The principal use of the quotative is to explicitly mark reported speech. The
	reported clause is separated from the rest of the sentence by the particleto-že.</p>

<p>The particle to-že is in fact made up of two separate clitics: the particle to
which is used to mark relative clauses, and -že which is the primary quotative
particle. This is made more evident in nested quotations, where -že can only
be attached to the rightmost reported clause:</p>

<p>The use of pronouns in quoted clauses is similar to English, with the main
exception being the use of the reflexive se if the subject of the quoted clause is
the same as the subject of the main clause. This is true even if the subject of
the main clause is a pronoun.</p>

<p>The verb zěká, ‘to say’ is called a verbum dicendi from the Latin meaning
‘verb of speech/speaking.’ Other verba dicendi in Iridian include vadá, ‘to
think’; kvuštá, ‘to hear’; vidá, ‘to see’; hloupá, ‘to ask’; ohletá, ‘to remember’;
sehová, ‘to recount, to tell a story’. Note that although they are called verbs
“of speaking” they do not necessarily introduce speech as much as function as
grammaticalized tags marking the quotative, which is more properly analyzed
to mark not just speech but inferentiality and evidentiality as well.</p>

<p>More complex verba dicendi can be formed by using an imperfect converbial construction
(the converb form in -ěc) with a canonical verbum dicendi.
To illustrate this consider the following sentences in English:</p>

<h2 id="rel-comp-const">Comparative constructions</h2>

<p>The clitic <span class="ir">tám</span> is used to form simple comparative and relative constructions.
<span class="ir">Tám</span> is often ommitted where the comparison can be implied from context. In
this construction, the standard of comparison (the noun preceded by ‘than’ in
English) is unmarked and the noun being compared marked in the agentive if
it is a positive/negative comparison, or in the instrumental if it is a correlation.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janek(-tám)</p><p class="en">Janek</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Markám</p><p class="en">Marek-<span class="gloss">agt</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">nestaževí.</p><p class="en">tall-<span class="gloss">cont</span></p></div>

		<p>‘Marek is as tall as Janek.’</p>
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Note that <span class="ir">tám</span> can only be used with the copulative form of the stative verb,
as the attributive and nominal forms have separate conjugated comparative
forms. When using these forms, however, the standard of comparison is
marked in the genitive. In relative constructions, the instrumental is also
replaced with the genitive, but the modifier <span class="ir">zní</span>, ‘same’ is added before the
stative verb.</p>
