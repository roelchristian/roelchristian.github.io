<h1> Clause structure</h1>

{% include under-construction.html %}

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
verb should appear at the end of a sentence.

<h2 id="topic-pred">Topic-predicate constructions</h2>
<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
sentence is structured.

<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
information afterwards.
<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Martha saw John.</li>
			<li>A dog bit Martha.</li>
			<li>It is raining today.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>[Janek]<sub>Top</sub> [mlaza boulešik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
			<p>‘As for Janek, he killed his brother.’</li>
			<li><p>[Tereza]<sub>Top</sub> [jecám nalečnik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog.’</li>
			<li><p>[Shléd]<sub>Top</sub> [zniepšalí.]<sub>Pred</sub>
			<p>‘As for today, it is raining.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb,
and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>Tereza jecám nalečnik.
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog’</li>
			<li><p>Jec Tereze nalčešik.
			<p>‘As for the dog, it bit Tereza.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>As Kiss (2004: 9) notes:
<blockquote>
We tend to describe eventsfrom a human perspective, as statements
about theirhuman participants – and subjects are more often [+human]
  than objects are. Inthe case of verbs with a [–human] subject
and a [+human] accusative or obliquecomplement, the most common permutation is that in which the accusative oroblique complement occupies the topic position [.] When the possessor is theonly
  human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]</blockquote>

<h2>Coordination</h2>
Iridian has three groups of coordinating conjunctions: the additive a, ‘and’
and še, ‘with’; the contrastive má and ozná (both translated to English as
‘but’); and the disjunctive/correlative je, le and ni.
A corresponds to the English ‘and.’ When coordinating simple noun pairs,
however, še, ‘i’s more often used though. The derived construction a še is also
common and has a similar meaning to the English ‘and also’.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Mámka</p><p class="en">mother<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">še</p><p class="en"><span class="gloss">com</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">pápku</p><p class="en">father-<span class="gloss">dim-ins</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">na</p><p class="en"><span class="gloss">loc</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Prahe</p><p class="en">Prague-<span class="gloss">acc</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">spaníček.</p><p class="en">vacation-<span class="gloss">av-pf</span></p></div>

	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘Mom and Dad went to Prague for vacation.’
	</div>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<div class="gloss-block">
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Janek</p><p class="en">mother<span class="gloss">dim</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">a</p><p class="en"><span class="gloss">and</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">še</p><p class="en"><span class="gloss">com</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">Marku</p><p class="en">Marek-<span class="gloss">dim-ins</span></p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">kurs</p><p class="en">class</p></div>
		<div class="unit"><p class="ird">hlupinžice.</p><p class="en">fail-<span class="gloss">av-pf-qt</span></p></div>

	</div>
	<div class="gloss-block-trl">
		‘Janek as well as Marek failed the class.’
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>In constructions with še where one of the nouns coordinated is a pronoun
or a deictic, the pronoun or deictic is presented first followed by the other
noun in the instrumental case.
	
(12) Dá
1s.str
še
com
Ivanu
Ivan-ins
sohladoušce.
classmate
‘Ivan and I are classmates.’
<p>In a few cases, a is used instead of še where the latter can be interpreted as
having an attributive meaning. Where the noun is marked, however, only a
can be used.
(13) a. trava
bread
še
com
lépu
cheese-ins
‘bread with cheese’ i.e., ‘cheese
sandwich’
b. trava
bread
a
and
lép
cheese
‘bread and cheese’
(14) To
this
kurs-te

a
and

Marek-agt
hlupienince.
class
‘It was this class that Marek and Janek failed.’
The bisyndetic coordination (Velupillai 2012) a Y a Y is also with similar
emphatic meaning as a še.

<h2 id="apposition">Apposition</h2>
<p>Appositive constructions in Iridian involve the juxtaposition of two or more
noun phrases that have a single referent. An apposition can be non-restrictive
if the appositive can be removed freely without changing the meaning of a
sentence, or restrictive otherwise.
  
<p>Formally both non-restrictive and restrictive appositives are treated as modifier phrases but only the latter is grammaticalized. The restrictive appositive
must always precede the noun phrase it modifies, linked together by the particle ko. Non-restrictive appositives on the other hand are simply juxtaposed
together, although a comma is often inserted around the appositive if it consists of more than one word.

<p>Examples(28a) and (28b) shows two different translations of the English
phrase ‘My brother Óto is studying in Munich.’ Example (28a) is nonrestrictive and can be interpreted as ‘I have a brother namsed Óto who is
studying in Munich’ while (28b) being restrictive can be translated more on
the lines of ‘Among my brothers, it is Óto who is studying in Munich.’ The
restrictive appositive implies specificity and by extension the existence of a
group where this specificity holds true; in (28b) this is taken to mean that a
set of brothers exists and Óto is a member of this set.

<h2 id="event-part-nom">Syntax of event and participant nominals</h2>
As we have established in § 3.9.2, Iridian has three forms of nominalisation:
(1) the mainly non-productive usage of the nominalising -ou with the verbal
stem to form resultant nominals; (2) the use of -ou in conjunction with the
gerund-forming prefix po(d)- to form a verbal noun (which we call an event
nominal or gerund) and which may either include the internal arguments
of the parent verb or not; and (3) the formation of a participant nominal
(cf. Pearson 2013) which nominalises not the event described by the verb but
its participants.
