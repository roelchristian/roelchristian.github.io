	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.

	<p>The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative
	nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes
	word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main
	verb should appear at the end of a sentence.
		
	<p>The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
	or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate
	or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the
	topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the
	topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the
	sentence is structured.

	<p>The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject
	of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (1);
	although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence,
	as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages,
	requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the
	information afterwards.
		
	<div class="ex-cont">
	<ol class="example">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Martha saw John.</li>
				<li>A dog bit Martha.</li>
				<li>It is raining today.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><p>[Janek]<sub>Top</sub> [mlaza boulešik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Janek, he killed his brother.’</li>
				<li><p>[Tereza]<sub>Top</sub> [jecám nalečnik.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog.’</li>
				<li><p>[Shléd]<sub>Top</sub> [zniepšalí.]<sub>Pred</sub>
				<p>‘As for today, it is raining.’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

<p>More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb,
and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

<div class="ex-cont">
<ol class="example">
	<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>Tereza jecám nalečnik.
			<p>‘As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog’</li>
			<li><p>Jec Tereze nalčešik.
			<p>‘As for the dog, it bit Tereza.’</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>As Kiss (2004: 9) notes:
<blockquote>
We tend to describe eventsfrom a human perspective, as statements
about theirhuman participants – and subjects are more often [+human]
  than objects are. Inthe case of verbs with a [–human] subject
and a [+human] accusative or obliquecomplement, the most common permutation is that in which the accusative oroblique complement occupies the topic position [.] When the possessor is theonly
  human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]</blockquote>
