    job-description: "I was hired as a Spanish resource for a engagement with a US-based client. I also created a tool to automate ticket tracking and report generation for use in monitoring weekly and monthly account performance. I also worked with the Quality team to assess engagement opportunities and ways to better deal with engagement data by standardizing collection and archiving. Recently I joined a Continuous Improvement training where I submitted a six-sigma project aimed at reducing turnaround time for one of our LOBs."
