        Clause-linking strategies
    </h2>
    <p>
        To communicate more complex ideas, it may sometimes be necessary to link two or more sentences together in a single sentence or in a sequence of sentences. In English this is commonly done by using conjunctions such as ‘and,’ ‘but,’ ‘or,’ etc. or relative pronouns like ‘that’ or ‘which.’ The choice of which connector to use depends on the type of relationship between the two clauses. We will consider three broad types of clause linking strategies: 
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Temporal succession
    </h3>
    <p>
        The conjunctive ending <span class="cyr">
            -ни
        </span> ‘and then’ is used to link two sequential clauses; the secondary clause, which occurs first, indicates the first occuring event while the main clause indicates the second event.
    </p>
    
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Марку хоўчицени тѣтра-до заби стожек.
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘I met Marek and then we went to the theater together.’</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>
        Complementation
    </h2>
    <p>
        Complement clauses in Iridian are marked by either <span class="cyr">ну</span> or <span class="cyr">тебы</span>. The choice between the two is determined by the type of complement clause. <span class="cyr">Тебы</span> is used where the subordinate clause is a question whether direct or indirect, while <span class="cyr">ну</span> is used in all other cases. Both <span class="cyr">ну</span> and <span class="cyr">тебы</span> require the complement clause to be in the conjunctive form. Unlike in English, the complement clause in Iridian appears before the main clause.
