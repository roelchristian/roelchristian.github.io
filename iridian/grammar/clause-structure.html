        Clause-linking strategies
    </h2>
    <p>
        To communicate more complex ideas, it may sometimes be necessary to link two or more sentences together in a single sentence or in a sequence of sentences. In English this is commonly done by using conjunctions such as ‘and,’ ‘but,’ ‘or,’ etc. or relative pronouns like ‘that’ or ‘which.’ The choice of which connector to use depends on the type of relationship between the two clauses. We will consider three broad types of clause linking strategies: 
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Temporal succession
    </h3>
    <p>
        The conjunctive ending <span class="cyr">
            -ни
        </span> ‘and then’ is used to link two sequential clauses; the secondary clause, which occurs first, indicates the first occuring event while the main clause indicates the second event.
    </p>

        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘I met Marek and then we went to the theater together.’</p>
        </div>

    <h2>
        Complementation
    </h2>
    <p>
        Complement clauses in Iridian are marked by either <span class="cyr">ну</span> or <span class="cyr">тебы</span>. The choice between the two is determined by the type of complement clause. <span class="cyr">Тебы</span> is used where the subordinate clause is a question whether direct or indirect, while <span class="cyr">ну</span> is used in all other cases. Both <span class="cyr">ну</span> and <span class="cyr">тебы</span> require the complement clause to be in the conjunctive form. Unlike in English, the complement clause in Iridian appears before the main clause.
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Тереза Янкам хлоўбжебіѣ ну Марци бых зѣк.
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Yesterday Marek said that Janek loves Tereza.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Тереза Янкам хлоўбжебіѣ тебы Марци дѣне хевор?
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Do you think Marek knows that Janek loves Tereza?’</p>
        </div>

    <h3>
        Bare quotatives
    </h3>
    <p>
        As has been briefly mentioned in § 7.6.2, quotative constructions may also appear without an overt main clause. We call this construction a bare qotative after the terminology in Tomioka and Kim (2019). In most cases, bare quotatives are not used to mark a speech act, but rather to indicate the speaker’s judgment or evaluation of a proposition. This usage is similar to the use of a conjunctive ending <span class="cyr">-ма</span> to ‘soften’ a statement (see § 7.4.2) and show hesitation or uncertainty. When a bare quotative is used in this way, it serves to show the speaker’s emotional or cognitive distance from the information being presented. This can be done for various reasons, such as to avoid being held accountable for the information if the speaker is unsure of its accuracy, to be polite by not being too direct with the listener, or to express irony or sarcasm. This non-reportative use can be extended even to utterances which directly come from the speaker but from which the speaker wishes to establish distance due to the reasons stated above.

        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">(Context: The speaker ironically comments about another customer in the shop who is complaining at the counter, blind with rage.) ‘You can tell he's angry.’</p>
