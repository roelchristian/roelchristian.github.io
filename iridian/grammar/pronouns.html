        Declension of personal pronouns
    </h3>
    <p>
        Personal pronouns in Iridian are inflected for person, number, and case. As with English, there are three grammatical persons in Iridian: the first person, which is used to refer to the speaker; the second person, used to refer to the addressee; and the third person used to refer to anything else. Iridian, however, distinguishes between animate and inanimate third persons. The animate third person is used to refer to people, animals, and other living things, while the inanimate third person is used to refer to inanimate objects. Like <a href="nouns.html">nouns</a>, pronouns are inflected for case. While number, however, is not marked on nouns, pronouns are inflected for number as well. Unlike nouns, too, the forms of personal pronouns are mainly irregular. The table below shows the personal pronouns in Iridian.

        Weak forms
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pronouns may also appear as clitics attached to the end of a noun or a verb phrase. This is called the weak form of the pronoun. When attached to a noun, the weak form of the pronoun is used to indicate possession. When attached to a verb phrase, the weak form of the pronoun is used to indicate the subject of the verb. The table below shows the weak forms of the personal pronouns in Iridian.

    <p>
        Iridian is a pro-drop language and so the subject pronoun is often omitted when it is clear from the context. It may be included however for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity. The weak form of the pronoun is used with the conjunctive form of the verb, in which case the final <span class="orthographic">-е/ѣ</span> of the conjunctive is elided.
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="ird-text">
            <span class="cyr">Сам травы здалѣк. Сам травы здаліицим.</span>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The unmarked strong form may simultaneously be used with the weak form of the pronoun for emphasis.

        Usage
    </h3>

    <p>
        The second person singular form is considered informal and is used only with close friends and family. When speaking with strangers or in formal situations, the second person plural or the third person animate plural is often preferred, with the latter being the more formal of the two. For example, a waiter will only ever address a customer using the <span class="cyr">сы</span> forms while the latter may use either the <span class="cyr">сы</span> or <span class="cyr">това</span> forms when addressing the waiter. 
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="ird-text">
            To a friend: <span class="cyr">Ли же пящиція?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="ird-text">
            To a stranger or an acquaintance: <span class="cyr">Ли же пящицаву?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="ird-text">
            To one&rsquo;s grandfather, for example: <span class="cyr">Ли же пящицаль?</span>
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Have you eaten yet?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Another common alternative would be to use the title or occupation of the person being addressed instead. (Using the name of the person being addressed may be considered impolite, and is reserved for close friends and family.) For example, a patient may address their doctor as <span class="cyr">Саўца</span> &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; (or its equivalent vocative form <span class="cyr">Саўцоў</span>). This usage may be supplemented by the use of the <span class="cyr">сы</span> form (and never the <span class="cyr">това</span> form). Pronoun dropping is less common in more formal situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first person plural may be used in a similar fashion in formal contexts or when the speakers wishes to communicate their humility. The choice of pronouns and the degree of formality is determined by the context and the speaker’s attitude towards themself and/or the listener.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of possessive pronouns is less common in Iridian than it is in English. Where the possessor is clear from the context, the possessive pronoun can and is often omitted. When referring to body parts, in particular, the possessive pronoun is often not used, and where it is used, the patientive and not the genitive pronoun is employed. Thus the English sentence &lsquo;My knees hurt&rsquo; would be translated as <span class="cyr">Длинь (доня) прозичиме</span> with <span class="cyr">доня</span> being optional; this sentence can more literally be translated as &lsquo;The knees are hurting (on me)&rsquo; (cf. Spanish &lsquo;Me duelen las rodillas&rsquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
        Another difference between Iridian and English pronouns is the fact that Iridian pronouns can be modified by attributive phrases like any other noun. For example, <span class="cyr">зушталніи да</span>, ‘I who am happy’ or more literally, ‘(the) happy I’ is a perfectly grammatical construction in Iridian while the equivalent in English would mostly be reserved in literary contexts, if at all, or more commonly rephrased with a relative clause ‘I, who am happy, ...’ or an apposition ‘I, the happy one, ...’.

        The reflexive <span class="cyr">ко</span>

    <p>
        The unmarked reflexive may also be used as an intensifier modifying the subject of the sentence (whether it is a pronoun or a noun) but would require the predicate verb phrase to be nominalized.
