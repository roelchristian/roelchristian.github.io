        Adverbial particles
    </h2>
    <p>
        Adverbial particles are a small class of words that are similar to one an- other in exhibiting proclitic behavior. Notwithstanding certain predictable exceptions discussed in this section, adverbial particles must obligatorily appear before the predicate they modify. We use the term ‘adverbial’ as the group generally behaves like adverbs, i.e., they modify verbs and verbal phrases, other adverbs, or whole sentences, although most Iridian grammars simply refer to them as <span class="cyr">земо</span>,
        literally meaning ‘grain’ or ‘particle.’ They also display functions not typically associated with adverbs, such as the ability to express evidentiality or mirativity, among other things. A single particle may also be used in multiple ways, as we will see in the following sections. The full list of adverbial particles is given in Table 5.1.

        According to Zwicky and Pullum’s (1983) criteria for clitichood, clitics generally exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their host while affixes exhibit a high degree of selection with respect to their stems. Adverbial particles can attach to words of virtually any category, as long as they appear in the predicate position. For example (the &lsquo;=&rsquo; symbol is used to indicate cliticization):
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Марек же=саўста. Aндрей саўсци по=аніи.
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Marek is already a doctor. Andrej is not yet a doctor.’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Янек ли=здравжія?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Is Janek sleeping?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Тереза бых по=дума-на.
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Tereza has been home since yesterday.’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        As proclitics, adverbial particles must appear directly before the verb they are associated with. Thus any other arguments a verb may have will normally appear before any adverbial particle. Consider for example a sentence like <span class="cyr">То том Янкам купник</span>,
        ‘This book was bought by Janek.’ Any particle that will be added to modify the sentence will appear after the subject <span class="cyr">То том</span> and the agent <span class="cyr">Янкам</span> but immediately before the verb <span class="cyr">купник</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            То том Янкам ли=купник?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Did Janek buy this book?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            То том Янкам камо=ли=купник?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Did Janek buy this book, (someone is asking me)?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            То том Янкам оче=изды=може=што=купник.
