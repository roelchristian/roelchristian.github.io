        Adverbial particles
    </h2>
    <p>
        Adverbial particles are a small class of words that are similar to one an- other in exhibiting proclitic behavior. Notwithstanding certain predictable exceptions discussed in this section, adverbial particles must obligatorily appear before the predicate they modify. We use the term ‘adverbial’ as the group generally behaves like adverbs, i.e., they modify verbs and verbal phrases, other adverbs, or whole sentences, although most Iridian grammars simply refer to them as <span class="cyr">земо</span>,
        literally meaning ‘grain’ or ‘particle.’ They also display functions not typically associated with adverbs, such as the ability to express evidentiality or mirativity, among other things. A single particle may also be used in multiple ways, as we will see in the following sections. The full list of adverbial particles is given in Table 5.1.

        According to Zwicky and Pullum’s (1983) criteria for clitichood, clitics generally exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their host while affixes exhibit a high degree of selection with respect to their stems. Adverbial particles can attach to words of virtually any category, as long as they appear in the predicate position. For example (the &lsquo;=&rsquo; symbol is used to indicate cliticization):
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Марек же=саўста. Aндрей саўсци по=аніи.
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Marek is already a doctor. Andrej is not yet a doctor.’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Янек ли=здравжія?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Is Janek sleeping?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            Тереза бых по=дума-на.
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Tereza has been home since yesterday.’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        As proclitics, adverbial particles must appear directly before the verb they are associated with. Thus any other arguments a verb may have will normally appear before any adverbial particle. Consider for example a sentence like <span class="cyr">То том Янкам купник</span>,
        ‘This book was bought by Janek.’ Any particle that will be added to modify the sentence will appear after the subject <span class="cyr">То том</span> and the agent <span class="cyr">Янкам</span> but immediately before the verb <span class="cyr">купник</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            То том Янкам ли=купник?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Did Janek buy this book?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            То том Янкам камо=ли=купник?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘Did Janek buy this book, (someone is asking me)?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            То том Янкам оче=изды=може=што=купник.
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">‘It looks like Janek bought this book contrary to what we might have thought before, though I’m still not sure.’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Moving the particle to any other position in the sentence other than immediately before the verb will result in an ungrammatical sentence, like the following
    </p>
    <div class="gloss-wrapper">
        <p class="cyr ird-text">
            * То том може=ли=Янкам купник?
        </p>
        <div class="gloss-sub">
            <p class="en-translation">Incorrect translation of: ‘Did Janek buy this book, too?’</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        When two or more particles are proclitic to the same predicate, their relative word order may be described in terms of the following hierarchy, in relation to their distance from the predicate:

            <tr>
                <th>Class</th>

                    <span class="cyr">же</span>
                    and
                    <span class="cyr">по</span>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Class II</td>

                    <span class="cyr">дѣне</span>
                    and
                    <span class="cyr">млада</span>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <h3 class="grammar-header">
        Class I: <span class="cyr">же</span> and <span class="cyr">по</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The two Class I adverbial particles
        <span class="cyr">же</span> and <span class="cyr">по</span> never occur in immediate sequence to each other. In general, <span class="cyr">же</span> and по carry aspect-related meanings, with <span class="cyr">же</span> used to indicate the perfective and <span class="cyr">по</span> the imperfective aspect. This usage, however, does not completely correspond to the true aspectual suffixes on a verb, as we have seen in § 3.4. <span class="cyr">Же</span> and <span class="cyr">по</span> can be broadly translated as ‘already’ and ‘still/yet’, respectively, but their usage as we will see below is more complex.
    </p>
    <p>
        In sentences containing a temporal clause expressing a future event, <span class="cyr">же</span> and <span class="cyr">по</span> are used to indicate the attitude of the speaker towards the time described in the predicate. <span class="cyr">Же</span> ‘extends’ the perceived time between the reference point and the time described by the predicate, while <span class="cyr">по</span> ‘shortens’ it. Thus a neutral sentence such as <span class="cyr">Янек соботу щенжах</span>, ‘Janek will arrive on Saturday’ can be modified as <span class="cyr">Янек соботу же щенжах</span> or as <span class="cyr">Янек соботу по щенжах</span>. The former indicates that the speaker thinks that there is little time left before Janek’s arrival on Saturday, while the latter indicates that the speaker thinks that there is still a lot of time left before Janek’s arrival on Saturday. In contrast to these two, the original sentence without <span class="cyr">же</span> or <span class="cyr">по</span> does not pass any judgment on the time left before Janek’s arrival. With temporal clauses expressing past events, <span class="cyr">по</span> behaves the same way in ‘extending’ the perceived time between the reference point and the time described by the predicate; <span class="cyr">же</span> on the other hand cannot be used in this way. Thus <span class="cyr">Янек соботу щенжах</span>, ‘Janek arrived on Saturday’ can be modified as <span class="cyr">Янек соботу по щенжах</span> which can be interpreted as ‘Janek arrived on Saturday (and it has been quite some time since then).’ <span class="cyr">Янек соботу же щенжах</span> is also a valid sentence, but here <span class="cyr">же</span> merely translates as ‘already’ and does not have the aspectual connotation it has in the future tense.
