    <h2>
        Verb stem and order of inflectional affixes
    </h2>
    <p>
        The citation form (or dictionary form or lemma) of a verb is the uninflected infinitive. This is a fossilized form and is not used in the language outside of this one purpose. The infinitive ends with the vowel <span class="cyr">-а</span> or <span class="cyr">-я</span>, and removing this ending will produce the verb stem. The final consonant of the stem is called the thematic consonant and determines the conjugation paradigm the verb follows. The verbal stem may appear independently either as a bare imperative or as a deverbal noun.

    <h2>
        Aspect
    </h2>
    <p>
        Grammatical aspect (or simply aspect) is a category in Iridian that is used to denote how an action or state described by a verb extends over time. Aspect contrasts with tense which situates an action or event as happening or being true at some specific point in time. Iridian does not mark tense grammatically, as does English, for example, and so the verb in English sentences ‘I am watching a movie on TV now’ and ‘I was watching a movie on TV when you called’ will both be translated using the same verb in the progressive aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aspect also contrasts with lexical aspect or aktionsart in that the latter, although also describing a verb’s structure in relation to time, refers more to an inherent property of the verb itself and is thus often invariant. Iridian also does not grammaticalize aktionsart, and thus the distinction between, say, Polish imperfective <span class="foreign-text">pisać</span>, ‘to write’ and perfective <span class="foreign-text">napisać</span>, ‘to write down,’ is not one made in the language (cf. Richardson 2007: 9–26; Comrie 1976).
    </p>
    <p>
        Iridian formally distinguishes between seven classes of grammatical as- pect, five of which are called primary since they are used to describe the aspect of an independent main verb while two are called secondary since they represent a verb’s aspect in relation to some other event. The endings are as follows:

    <h3>
        Perfective aspect
    </h3>
    <p>
        Both the perfective aspect is used to represent actions that have been completed at some point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The perfective aspect indicates an action that has been completed at some specific point in time. The thematic ending for the perfective aspect is <span class="cyr">-ек</span> 
        , but the initial <span class="cyr">-е</span>  is unstable and changes depending on the environment. It becomes <span class="cyr">-и</span>  after the patientive <span class="cyr">-ин-</span>  and the benefactive <span class="cyr">-еб-</span>; the use with the passive <span class="cyr">-ин-</span> also triggers the syncope of the initial <span class="cyr">-и-</span> in <span class="cyr">-ин-</span> or its conversion to an <span class="cyr">-е-</span> where sonority rules do not allow the resulting consonant cluster. Thus a verb like <span class="cyr">пяшта</span>, ‘to eat’ will have the forms <span class="cyr">пяштник</span>, ‘was eaten’ and <span class="cyr">пяштебик</span>, ‘was fed’ instead of <span class="cyr">*пяштинек</span> and <span class="cyr">*пяштебек</span>, respectively.

    The retrospective aspect is used for a past action that has a continuing relevance in the presence. Often when using the retrospective aspect, the emphasis is on the resulting state rather than the event itself. Consider, for example, the following sentences: (a) ‘I went to Amsterdam last week’; and (b) ‘I have been to Berlin in my childhood’. Iridian would translate the verb in (a) using the perfective and the verb in (b) using the retrospective. The retrospective may also be called the perfect in other sources but we shall be solely referring to it as the former in this grammar to avoid any confusion. In addition, the retrospective in Iridian always has a perfective interpretation, i.e., a sentence like ‘I have been waiting here an hour’ which has a verb in the perfect is translate using the progressive instead of the retrospective.

    </span><br>
    ‘I have tried vegetarian goulash before but I did not like it at all.’
</p>

<h3>Continuous and progressive aspect</h3>
<p>
Iridian uses the continuous and progressive aspects to denote actions that have not been completed yet and/or are in the process of happening/occuring. The continuous aspect (glossed cont) is used to mark a state of being while the progressive aspect (glossed prog) is used to mark a dynamic activity.

    Хура уриштниме.
    </span><br>
    ‘I am getting dressed, i.e., I am putting on clothes.’
</p>
<p>
    The continuous aspect is also used to denote a habitual action or state.

    <h2>
        Grammatical mood (<span class="cyr">хтѣ</span>)
    </h2>
    <p>grammatical mood is a grammatical category that expresses the attitude of the speaker or writer with respect to the proposition expressed by the verb. In Iridian, there are four grammatical moods: indicative, imperative, hortative, and conditional. Thus far, we have only discussed the indicative mood, which is the ‘default’ verbal mood in most statements, as this mood is used to express propositions that are true. The other three moods are used to express propositions that are not necessarily true, but rather express the speaker’s attitude towards the proposition. The imperative mood is used to express commands and prohibitions, the hortative mood is used to express requests and wishes, and the conditional mood is used to express propositions that are false, or whose truth is unknown or uncertain or dependent on some other condition. In this section, we will discuss the other three moods in more detail.</p>

    <h3>
        Imperative and hortative mood
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        To form commands and requests, the imperative (glossed imp) and hortative (hort) moods are used in Iridian.
    </p>
    <p>
        The imperative is formed by replacing the infinitive ending <span class="cyr">-а</span> with the voice marker and the imperative ending <span class="cyr">-им</span>. Since the imperative cannot be negated with the prefix <span class="cyr">за</span>, a separate negative imperative ending <span class="cyr">-уя</span> is used to form negative commands/prohibitions. Similarly, the hortative is formed by using the hortative ending <span class="cyr">-еж</span>; it cannot be negated either by the prefix <span class="cyr">за</span> and so a separate negative hortative ending <span class="cyr">-ите</span> is used instead. The table below shows the imperative and hortative endings for the verb <span class="cyr">пяшта</span>, ‘to eat’.

    <p>
        Due to its directness, the use of the imperative or the prohibitive is considered impolite in most settings, and is often used only when speaking with friends, family or children. This distinction does not exist in the written language, in particular in the case of signages, user manuals, and other similar texts, where the imperative is used almost exclusively for these functions. In the spoken language, however, the hortative is preferred, especially in formal settings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conditional mood
    </h3>
    <p>
        The conditional mood is used in statements which are not true or verifiably true, or whose truth is unknown or is dependent on another condition. The use of the conditional mood include wishes, judgments, or opinions, among others. This form is also called the ‘conjunctive mood’ in other grammars (in contrast to the conjunctive form discussed in § 3.7), after the name in Iridian (<span class="cyr">конюнктивне хтѣ</span>)
        which itself borrows from the German Konjunktiv. There are two forms of the conditional, the imperfective and the perfective, distinguished by whether or not the purported action has been completed. These are formed by the suffixes <span class="cyr">-ы</span> and <span class="cyr">-а</span> respectively. The table below shows the conditional endings for the verb <span class="cyr">пяшта</span>, ‘to eat’.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Voice</th>
            <th>Imperfactive</th>
            <th>Perfective
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Agentive</td>
            <td><span class="cyr">пящы</span></td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patientive</td>
            <td><span class="cyr">пяштны</span></td>
            <td><span class="cyr">пяштна</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Benefactive</td>
            <td><span class="cyr">пяштебы</span></td>
            <td><span class="cyr">пяштеба</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Locative</td>
            <td><span class="cyr">пяштоўны</span></td>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>A verb in the conditional mood cannot be used as a main verb in a sentence. The use of the conditional mood falls into two main categories: conditional sentences (discussed in § ??) and subordination (discussed in § ??).</p>
    <p>
        The broadest of these use cases is the use of the conditional mood in clause of purpose, which is used in expressions of purpose, intention, or desire. The subordinate clause is usually marked by the particle <span class="cyr">ну</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Марку содалшы ну стожек.
        </span><br>
        ‘I came here so that I could talk to Marek.’
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Янек заведны ну ражек.
        </span><br>
        'Janek left so that he could not be seen.'
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
            Марек кразенжы ну Янек жичек.
        </span><br>
        ‘Janek told Marek to sing.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Indirect questions follow the same pattern as indirect commands. They are used when quoting or embedding a direct question or when the speaker wants to ask the addressee a question indirectly. A direct question is terminated by
        <span class="cyr">тебы</span> ‘whether’ rather than <span class="cyr">ну</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">

        </span><br>
        ‘I am still wondering where I have left my keys.’

    <h2>
        Conjunctive form (<span class="cyr">бежия мук</span>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The conjunctive form (called бежия мук, ‘linking form or bridging form’ in Iridian) is used in verbs appearing in secondary clauses in a sentence. It originated as a way to mark reported speech and evidentiality in Old Iridian, and while the conjunctive form is still used for this purpose in Modern Iridian, the usage has expanded to include relative clauses, subordination and other forms of clause linking. The use of the conjunctive form is discussed in detail in § 7.4. The conjunctive form of a verb is formed by adding the suffix <span class="cyr">-е</span> to the fully-conjugated verb, often resulting to the palatalization of the final consonant in the suffix. The table below shows the conjunctive form of the verb <span class="cyr">пяшта</span>, ‘to eat’.

        Relative clauses are formed by placing the modifying clause immediately before the noun it modifies. The verb in the modifying clause is in the &lsquo;attributive&rsquo; form, which is essentially the conjunctive form followed by the affix <span class="cyr">-нь</span>.

    <h2>
        Stative verbs
    </h2>
    <p>Iridian lacks a distinct class of adjectives. Instead, a special class of verbs called stative verbs are used to modify noun or noun-like classes. Unlike most verbs, however, stative verbs can only be marked for aspect and voice. In addition to this base form (called the copulative), stative verbs also have an attributive form (used when the verb is preceding the noun or noun phrase) and nominative form (representing a concrete nominalization of the verb), both of which are absent in non-attributive verbs.</p>

    <p>The attributive form is formed by adding the suffix <span class="cyr">-ніи</span> to the verb stem while the nominative form is formed by directly from the verb stem, subject to the usually phonological constraints. For example, the verb <span class="cyr">вшиха</span>, ‘to be angry’ has the attributive form <span class="cyr">вшихніи</span> and the nominative form <span class="cyr">вших</span>.</p>
    <p>
        The comparative is formed by using the suffix <span class="cyr">-нены</span> instead of <span class="cyr">-ніи</span>; Iridian does not have a distinct superlative form. The comparative form is often used, especially in colloquial speech, as an intensifier, even if the stative verb is not actually used in a comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Bшихнены мамка телевониржек.
        </span><br>
        ‘My mother was very angry when she called.’ (lit. angrier)
    </p>
    <p>
        The copulative form behaves like a normal verb and can be marked for aspect, voice, and mood, among others. When used in copular constructions, however, the attributive form is used.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Мамка Янкам вшихнек.</span>
        <br>
        ‘Janek angered (his) mother.’
    </p>
    <p>
        But:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Мамка вшихніи.
        </span><br>
        (‘My) mother is angry.’
    </p>
    <p>
        As with regular verbs, the copulative form can be used in relative clauses, in which case in which case the verb takes the regular conjunctive form ending and the relativizing suffix <span class="cyr">-нь</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Тѣхо вшихнек. → <i>Bшихницень</i> Тѣхо сноў упрожилшах.
        </span><br>
        ‘(You) have angered God.’ → ‘God, whom you have angered, will soon seek his revenge.’
    </p>
    <p>
        When using multiple stative verbs as modifiers, the order is less
        restricted, with the order normally determined by whatever the speakers
        wants to emphasize. For example, one could write both
        <span class="cyr">глуцніи мордніи том</span>
        and
        <span class="cyr">мордніи глуцніи том</span>
        to mean ‘a thick, blue book’. It is also common, when using two stative
        verbs as modifiers, to use
        <span class="cyr">а</span>
        , ‘and’ to separate the two stative verbs, as in
        <span class="cyr">глуцніи а мордніи том</span>.

        Nominalized verb forms
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Event nominals and gerunds
    </h3>
    <p>
        Nominalization involves turning a verb or a verb phrase into a noun. The simplest such process is called <i>lexical nominalization</i> and involves an unmarked verb stem functioning as noun. For phonological reasons, this form of nominalization may also involve changes in the vowel of the stem as in <span class="cyr">вада</span> &lsquo;to think&rsquo; becoming <span class="cyr">вѣд</span> &lsquo;mind, thought&rsquo;. The resulting noun generally expresses a verb-like or actional meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Bлак 15 ору щенжах.
        </span><br>
        ‘The train will arrive at 3 o’clock.’
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Bлаци щен стѣпшія.
        </span><br>
        ‘They are waiting for the train’s arrival.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Another type of nominalization is the creation of the gerund, which generally corresponds to the English &lsquo;-ing&rsquo; form. There are two different types of gerunds in Iridian: the aspectless gerund, formed by adding the suffix <span class="cyr">-ла</span> to the infinitive and the perfective gerund, formed by adding the suffix <span class="cyr">-ц</span> to the infinitive. The perfective gerund would often be translated in English as &lsquo;having + past participle&rsquo;.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Participant nominals
    </h3>
    <p>
        Participant nominals are formed by nominalizing a finite verb phrase in the conjunctive form with the suffix
        <span class="cyr">-ла</span>.
        The resulting noun refers back to a participant in the event rather than the event itself, with the role determined by the grammatical voice in which the original verb phrase is marked. Consequently, participant nominals are inherently definite in meaning.

        Copular and existential constructions
    </h2>

    <h3>
        Copular constructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        There is no direct translation for the English verb ‘to be’ in Iridian. Instead, copular constructions are formed by juxtaposing the topic and the predicate. To negate a copular construction, the particle <span class="cyr">аніи</span> is used, with the noun phrase being negated placed in the genitive case. If the predicate is a stative verb, it is negated using the prefix <span class="cyr">за</span> as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Марек доктор.
        </span> →
        <span class="cyr">
        Марек доктори аніи.
        </span><br>
        ‘Marek is a doctor.’ → ‘Marek is not a doctor.’
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
        Марек зушталніи.
        </span> →
        <span class="cyr">
        Марек зазушталніи.
        </span><br>
        ‘Marek is happy.’ → ‘Marek is not happy.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, the verb <span class="cyr">са</span> &lsquo;to become&rsquo; can be used. This verb always takes an agentive meaning and can take an unmarked noun or a stative verb in its attributive form as its argument, e.g.,
        <span class="cyr">доктор са</span> &lsquo;to become a doctor&rsquo;, <span class="cyr">вшихніи са</span> &lsquo;to become angry&rsquo;. <span class="cyr">Са</span> can be inflected for aspect as any other verb, but does not take any voice markers. The aspect-marked forms of <span class="cyr">са</span> are as follows; the forms are all regular except for the perfective form, which is <span class="cyr">ска</span> instead of <span class="cyr">сек</span>.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Ending</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Perfective</td>

    <p>
        <span class="cyr">

        </span><br>
        ‘Martouva became president in 2008.’
    </p>
    Compare this with the following sentence, where no copula is used:
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
            Мартоўва 2008 хлету президент.
        </span><br>
        ‘Martouva was president in 2008.’
    </p>
    <p>
        When used in any of the two imperfective aspects, the verb <span class="cyr">са</span> only has the meaning of &lsquo;to become&rsquo; and cannot be used to express a state of being. The usual distinction between the continuous and progressive aspects holds. There are also two gerunds: the aspectless <span class="cyr">сяла</span> (instead of <span class="cyr">сала</span>) and the perfective <span class="cyr">сац</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
            Мартоўви Президент сяла/сац зушке малшек.
        </span><br>
        ‘Martouva's becoming/having become president pleased my grandmother.’
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">Са</span> constructions are negated by using the prefix <span class="cyr">за</span> on the verb, e.g., <span class="cyr">заска</span> &lsquo;did not become&rsquo;.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Existential constructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        An existential sentence is a specialized construction used to express the existence or presence of someone or something. In Iridian, the verbs <span class="cyr">іица</span> and its negative form <span class="cyr">быца</span> are used. Both verbs are defective like <span class="cyr">са</span> in that they cannot be marked for voice. The continuous form of <span class="cyr">іица</span> and <span class="cyr">быца</span> are both used to express general truths and other atemporal statements, while the progressive form is used to express ongoing or habitual actions. This is in contrast with other verbs where the continuous aspect is also used to express habitual actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
            На якую цед ли по іиція? Звиру на якую цед іициме.
        </span><br>
        ‘Does (the) tree have any fruits yet?’ (Lit., Are there any fruits yet in the tree?) ‘The tree will have fruits in the summer.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Existential constructions are also used to indicate possession, with the possessor marked in the accusative case.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
            На дума облашц іиція. Марка облашц іиція.
        </span><br>
        ‘We have a pet at home. Marek has a pet.’
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="cyr">
            На дума трава же быція. Марка оўблейка же быція.
        </span><br>
        ‘We have no more bread at home. Marek no longer has any parents.’
    </p>
