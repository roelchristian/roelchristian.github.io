title: Multiple wh-fronting in Iridian&#58; a comparative study
---


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Multiple <em>wh</em>-fronting involves the movement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>wh</em>-words</a> to the start of the sentence. Following <a href="#rudin1988">Rudin&rsquo;s (1988)</a> typology on her seminal paper on the topic, we can classify languages into three groups with regards to how their syntax operates on both simple and complex content questions. In the first group are languages like Chinese where <em>wh</em>-words always remain <em>in situ</em>, i.e., they inherit the position of the noun phrase they replace in the sentence, as we see in example (1a) below. In the second group are languages like English, where simple questions (i.e., questions with only one <em>wh</em>-item) while more complex ones only allow one <em>wh</em>-item to be fronted with the remaining <em>wh</em>-items remaining <em>in situ</em> (see example 1b). Finally we have a third group, which include among others Bulgarian or Romanian, that requires all <em>wh</em>-items to be moved clause-initially whenever possible. (In fact there is a fourth group, intermediate between the first and the second, and including languages like French, which allows for both the English-type and the Chinese-type treatment of multiple <em>wh</em>-items, as we see in example 1c below;  but we will be ignoring this further distinction as it is not relevant for the purposes of this article.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Iridian belongs to this fourth group, as do all Slavic languages and Romanian. Whether this characteristic is a consequence of Iridian syntax or brought about by the language&rsquo;s contact with the Slavic languages is unclear. It is most likely the first case though, since as we see in the case of Hungarian and Romanian, both non-Slavic languages forming part of the larger Central and Eastern European linguistic area (which for simplicity we will call the Slavo-Germanic <em>Sprachbund</em>), although multiple <em>wh-</em> fronting (MWF) is characteristically Slavic, its diffusion to the other languages in the region is not complete:</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol start="2">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Hungarian <a href="#kiss2004">(Kiss 2004: 100)</a><br>
					<u>Kit</u> vesz el <u>ki</u> a reg&eacute;ny  v&eacute;g&eacute;n?<br>

					‘Whom does who marry at the end of the novel?’
				</li>

				<li>Romanian <a href="rudin1988">(Rudin 1988: 449)</a><br>
					<u>Cine</u> <u>cu ce</u> merge?<br>
					who with what goes<br>
					&lsquo;Who goes by what?&rsquo; (i.e., means of transportation)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2><em>Wh</em>-fronting in simple questions</h2>

<p>The simple case of <em>wh</em>-fronting can be seen as an extension of Iridian&rsquo;s preference for copular constructions in explanatory or clarificatory sentences. That the simple WF in Iridian is essentially a copular construction is made more overt in colloquial speech by the tendency to nominalise the whole verb phrase altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol start="3">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Jede to mila šviržek?<br>
					&lsquo;Who wrote this song?&rsquo;
				</li>

				<li>With a nomimalised verb phrase (colloquial):<br>
					Jede to mila šviržkou?<br>
					&lsquo;Who wrote this song?&rsquo; (Lit., Who is the person who wrote this song?)
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

This is not extraordinary though, as we also see this verb phrase nominalisation in forming questions in other languages such as in English, where a relative clause (which we can view as a weak form of nominalisation) may be equated with a <em>wh</em>-item, albeit the resulting construction is more marked and emphatic. Another example is with Tagalog, a non-MWF language of the second type, which, unlike Iridian that allows both a verbal predicate and a nominalised one, requires the latter to form questions.

<blockquote>
	<ol start="4">
		<li>
			Sino ang nagsulat sa pader?<br>
			Who NOM wrote OBL wall<br>
			‘Who wrote on the wall?’ (Lit., Who is the person who wrote on the wall?)
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

Another feature Iridian shares with Tagalog and which is of direct consequence to how MWF is implemented in the language is how the thematic role of the <em>wh</em>-item affects the morphology of the verb phrase (nominalised or not) instead of the thematic role of the <em>wh</em>-item affecting its own morphology and the verb phrase remaining the same whatever <em>wh</em>-item is used. This is because <em>wh</em>-fronting promotes the <em>wh</em>-item to the topic position in the sentence and since Iridian syntax makes the morphology of the verb and the other elements of the sentence dependent on the thematic role of the topic, this means the conjugation of the verb phrase (specifically its grammatical voice) depends directly on which <em>wh</em>-item is used. As an indirect consequence of this, despite the <em>wh</em>-items being fully declinable, most questions are formed using the unmarked form of the question word. To illustrate this, consider the two pairs of sentences below in Iridian and Tagalog:

<blockquote>
	<ol start="5">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Iridian<br>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Jede na kinot&eacute;ka vižek?<br>
							&lsquo;Who saw you in the theatre?&rsquo;</li>
						<li>Jede na kinot&eacute;ka vednik?<br>
							&lsquo;Whom did you see in the theatre?&rsquo;</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Tagalog<br>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Sino ang tumawag sa&rsquo;yo kanina?<br>
							&lsquo;Who called you earlier?&rsquo;</li>
						<li>Sino ang tinawagan mo kanina?<br>
							&lsquo;Whom did you call earlier?&rsquo;</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Iridian examples above, jede ‘who’ stayed the same in both sentences even though it was thematically the actor in the first and the patient in the second; in English, on the other hand, the nominative ‘who’ was used in the first and the accusative ‘whom’ in the second (although colloquially ‘who’ is also acceptable in the second sentence and is in fact more common).</p>

<h2>Multiple <em>wh</em>-fronting</h2>

<p>In simple cases where MWF does not involve extraction of the <em>wh</em>-item from a <em>wh</em>-item embedded in another clause, it is the first <em>wh</em>-item that determines the grammatical voice in which the main verb is marked. Unlike normal nouns, however, the remaining <em>wh</em>-items are normally not conjugated to show their relationship to both the verb and the main <em>wh</em>-item.</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol start="6">
		<li>Jede ježe jena hloupškou?<br>
			‘Who asked what when?’</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>An exception to this would be when the same <em>wh</em>-item is used for elements with different roles in the sentence, in which case, Iridian requires all but one of the identical <em>wh</em>-items to be explicitly marked. In case one of these identical <em>wh</em>-items is in the topic position, the non-topic <em>wh</em>-items are the ones marked.</p>


<blockquote>
	<ol start="7">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>*Jede jede jena vednikou?<br>‘Who saw whom when?’</li>
				<li>Jena jede jední vednikou?<br>‘When did who see whom?’</li>
				<li>Jede jena jední vednikou?<br>‘Who was seen by whom when?’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>


<p>Most sentences that have multiple identical <em>wh</em>-items, however, contain an actor-patient pair of either <em>jede</em> ‘who’ or <em>ježe</em> ‘what’; in these cases, notwithstanding the above rules, the marked <em>wh</em>-item takes the genitive and become <em>jední</em> ‘whose, by whom, by what’ regardless of the thematic role of the <em>wh</em>-item in the topic. An identical <em>wh</em>-item pair (separated by a &lsquo;and&rsquo;) may be used however in case the second item was fronted from an embedded clause (see 8c).</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol start="8">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Jede jední vednikou?<br>
					‘Who was seen by whom?’
				</li>
				<li>Jede jední vižkou?<br>
					‘Who saw whom?’
				</li>
				<li>Jede a jede žiknice to-že žičkou?<br>
					‘Who told you (they) told whom?’
					</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

As in Bulgarian and Romanian (and interestingly, unlike nearby Czech and Polish), all <em>wh</em>-items are required to be fronted in Iridian whenever possible, even if this means extracting the <em>wh</em>-item from an embedded clause. Unlike Bulgarian, however, where the <em>wh</em>-item is moved to a position linguists call SpecCP (cf. <a href="#rudin1988">Rudin, ibid.</a>), which may precede a separate topic element, Iridian <em>wh</em>-movement involves promotion of the main <em>wh</em>-item to the topic position, which must always be the first element of the sentence. Compare for example the following sentences:


<blockquote>
	<ol start="9">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Bulgarian <a href="#rudin1988">(ibid., 451)</a><br>
					Борис на кого какво каза че ще даде?<br>
					Boris to whom what said that he will give-3s<br>
					‘What did Boris say that (he) will give to whom?’
				</li>
				<li>Iridian<br>
					Ježe jehát Borisám dejatnách to žiknou?<br>
					what to-whom by-Boris will-be-given that said<br>
					‘What did Boris say that (he) will give to whom?’
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

Another restriction in Bulgarian is the impossibility of <em>wh</em>-movement to the same clause for both a relative and an interrogative <em>wh</em>-item. Since Iridian does not use <em>wh</em>-items in relative clauses, this restriction does not apply in the language, and moreover would not normally require MWF.

<blockquote>
	<ol start="10">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Bulgarian (ibid., 451-2)
					<ol type="i">
						<li>*Човека, който какво не знаеш че е купил<br>
							the-man who-REL what NEG know-2s that hs bought
						</li>	
						<li>Човека, който не знаеш какво казват че е купил<br>
							the-man who-REL NEG know-2s what say-3p that has bought
						</li>	
					</ol>
					‘The man who you don’t know what they say that he bought …’
				</li>
				<li>Iridian<br>
					Ježe kupinenice to zázběrovneví ko maša<br>
					what was-bought-QUOT that NEG-not-known LNK man<br>
					‘The man who (you) don’t know what (they) say that he bought …’
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

Even in the case of nested subordinate clauses, Iridian requires that all <em>wh</em>-items be moved to the beginning of the sentence. The order in which the fronted <em>wh</em>-items appear must reflect the order in which the original clauses were embedded in the sentence:

<blockquote>
	<ol start="11">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>First-order nesting (single subordinate clause)
					<ol type="i">
						<li>[Avt sám kupinenice to-že] Marek žiček<br>
							‘Marek told me he bought a car.’</li>
						<li>Jede jední [ježe kupinenice to-že] žičkou?<br>
							Who told whom (he) bought what?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Second-order nesting (two subordinate clauses)
					<ol type="i">
						<li>[[Avt sám kupinenice to]<sub>1</sub> Tomáš žiknice to-že]<sub>2</sub> Marek žiček.<br>
							‘Marek told me he told Tomáš he bought a car.’</li>
						<li>Jede [a jede [ježe kupinenice to]<sub>1</sub> žiknice to-že]<sub>2</sub> žičkou?<br>
							‘Who told (you) he told whom that he bought what?’</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

As in most other languages, complex structures like this are often simplified in actual usage. Colloquial Iridian would normally only tolerate first-order nesting of questions, with any extra <em>wh</em>-item relegated to an explanatory clause introduced by <em>ase</em>.

<blockquote>
	<ol start="12">
		<li>Jí ješ jede ježe kupinenice to-že žiknice ko žičkou, ase jede ša?<br>
			2s exist who what was-bought QUOT was-told LNK said-NZ EXPL who 3s<br>
			‘Who told you he told whom that he bought what?’</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>We see that the MWF in embedded clauses is a direct consequence of Iridian&rsquo;s verb-final clause structure. Each embedded <em>wh</em>-clause can be removed freely without changing the structure of the clause where it was nested. Each clause functions independently of the other clauses and as we have mentioned earlier, moreover, it is the <em>wh</em>-item within each embedded clause that determines the morphology of the embedded verb phrase, not the <em>wh</em>-item nor the main verb phrase from the main clause.</p>

<h2>Further examples</h2>

<p>Like Bulgarian, Iridian allows the extraction of <em>wh</em>-items from one or more embedded questions. Iridian’s SOV word order, however, in comparison to Bulgarian’s SVO order, and its head-final branching means Iridian <em>wh</em>-fronting in embedded questions appears more overt in Iridian than in Bulgarian. MWF in embedded questions in Iridian requires the attachment of the particle ane ‘whether’ to the leftmost <em>wh</em>-item.</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol start="13">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Bulgarian <a href="#rudin1988">(ibid., 457)</a><br>
					Видях една книга, която се чудя [<u>кой</u> знае [<u>кой</u> продава.]<sub>1</sub>]<sub>2</sub></li>
				<li>[<u>Jede</u> ane [a <u>jede</u> slouvežit to]<sub>1</sub> zběrovževí to-že]<sub>2</sub> zaměc važime ko tóm vdenik.<br>
					‘I saw a book which I wonder who knows who sells (it).’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>


MWF can also be seen in relative <em>wh</em>-clauses. Clauses of this type are formed using the clitic <em>-te</em>, whose main function is to explicitly mark the focus of the sentence, but here extends to the creation of a relative clause. Since it is still, at least superficially, a focus particle, it can only appear once in the sentence, and in the case of multiple <em>wh</em>-items must be attached to the leftmost one.

<blockquote>
	<ol start="14">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Jede-te jena stojunit to česčivou ně malně znohouščáš.<br>
					‘Whoever wants to go anywhere needs to learn languages.’</li>
				<li>*Jede-te jena-te stojunit, etc.</li>
				<li>*Jede jena-te stojunit, etc.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>


The addition of <em>-te</em> makes the <em>wh</em>-clause take an indefinite meaning.

<blockquote>
	<ol start="15">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Jede-te shraženou záhevorneví.<br>
					‘I don’t know who(ever) died.’</li>
				<li>Shraženou záhevorneví.<br>
					‘I don’t know the person who died.’</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>In this post we presented a sketch of the multiple <em>wh</em>-fronting phenomenon in Iridian and compared it with the phenomenon as it appears in other languages in the region. We have argued that Iridian MWF is an indirect consequence of the underlying word order of the language and of its persistent head-final branching, and not as one might think a direct result of its extensive contact with Slavic languages throughout history. We supported this argument by showing that Iridian MWF is more similar to Romanian and Bulgarian MWF in requiring <em>wh</em>-movement in embedded clauses, instead of the system found in neighbouring Czech or Polish where embedded <em>wh</em>-items are kept in situ.  Iridian differs from Romanian and Bulgarian, nonetheless, in a few key aspects, including (1) the tendency to nominalise the main verb phrase and present the question as an equative construction between the <em>wh</em>-item and the nominalised verb phrase; (2) the free order in which fronted <em>wh</em>-items are presented in Iridian, unlike Romanian or Bulgarian, which gives preference in most cases to the nominative over the accusative; and (3) the way in which relative <em>wh</em>-items affect interrogative <em>wh</em>-items less prominently in Iridian, leading to, among others, persistence of <em>wh</em>-fronting in embedded questions even in places it would not have been possible in Romanian or Bulgarian.</p>

<p>Finally, although sufficient care has been taken in providing a good enough theoretical foundation for this article, this analysis was not built in any single linguistic theory. This was written by a non-linguist for non-linguists with the aim of providing a brief description of the MWF phenomenon in Iridian mainly through comparison with other languages; as such I hope the reader who finds himself in a more comfortable linguistic footing than myself may excuse my errors, theoretical or otherwise.</p>




<div class="note">
	<b>A note on the glosses.</b> I have reproduced the glosses in the examples I have cited from other authors verbatim, with the main exception being the Bulgarian and Russian ones which I reproduced here in their original script. This is a purely stylistic choice on my part. As for the glosses for the Iridian examples, I have taken quite a few liberties in deciding which morphemes get glossed and which ones get left out; since, after all, this blog post is focussed on syntax, I have opted to gloss only the morphemes I thought were most relevant to the understading of the examples instead of doing a full morpheme-by-morpheme gloss. In any case the glossing abbreviations I used in my examples are as follows: 1&thinsp;=&thinsp;first person; 2&thinsp;=&thinsp;second person; 3&thinsp;=&thinsp;third person; s&thinsp;=&thinsp;singular; p&thinsp;=&thinsp;plural; EXPL&thinsp;=&thinsp;expletive; LNK&thinsp;=&thinsp;linking particle; NEG&thinsp;=&thinsp;negative; NOM&thinsp;=&thinsp;nominative; NZ&thinsp;=&thinsp;nominalisation; OBL&thinsp;=&thinsp;oblique; QUOT&thinsp;=&thinsp;quotative mood, quotative particle.
