<section>
<p>Nietzsche in Section 40 of&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil&nbsp;</em>talks of
masks:</p>

        40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things
        have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the
        <em>contrary</em>&nbsp;only be the right disguise for the shame of a God
        to go about in? A question worth asking!—it would be strange if some
        mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There are
        proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them
        with coarseness and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love
        and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than
        to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his
        recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in
        order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame
        is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most
        ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask—there is so much
        goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and
        fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like
        an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame
        requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his
        destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach, and
        with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate
        friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their
        eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, which
        instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is
        inexhaustible in evasion of communication, <em>desires</em>&nbsp;and
        insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and
        heads of his friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will
        some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him
        there—and that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask;
        nay, more, around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask,
        owing to the constantly false, that is to say,
        <em>superficial</em>&nbsp;interpretation of every word he utters, every
        step he takes, every sign of life he manifests.&nbsp;<em>(Helen Zimmern
        translation)</em>

<p>The work&nbsp;<em>mask&nbsp;</em>has an interesting linguistic history. It is
originally a Germanic word that found its way to Latin, and from Latin—through
French—to English. The OED defines mask as&nbsp;“a covering for all or part of
the face, worn as a disguise, or to amuse or frighten others.” Under its
synonyms is listed the word <em>persona</em>, a related but somewhat very
different concept. Whereas a mask is essentially false (“a disguise”), a persona
is an extension of a person’s self, an image presented to the world which may or
may not be the authentic image of the self it presents but whose authenticity is
always out of the question. The mask and the wearer are distinct from each other
while the distinction between self and its personae is always hazy and
porous.</p>

<p>And Nietzsche here was talking of masks: the necessity for profound (German
<em>tief, </em>deep) spirits to present themselves to a scrutinizing world as
something other than what they are. And this is not an exhortation: Nietzsche
was not asking these “profound spirits” to don masks; instead he tells us that
by their very nature they have already disguised themselves from the world’s
unwanted inquiries. And if Nietzsche himself is a profound spirit, then this
image he presents of himself—and more trivially, his statement on masks—is
essentially false. We have then another dreary game of logic in which the only
answer is a non sequitur: Nietzsche is known for his contradictions, and here,
as anywhere else in his oeuvre, the importance of his statement does not depend
on whether he meant it or not.</p>
