title: Temporal clauses
---

<p>Temporal clauses in English are subordinate clauses introduced by the conjunction <em>when</em>:</p>

<blockquote><em><strong>When</strong> I was fifteen</em>, my family moved to Brno.</blockquote>

<p>In these blog post, we will explore three ways to form temporal clauses in Iridian.</p>

<h2>The conjunction <em>še</em></h2>

<p>The conjunction <em>še</em>, &#8216;with&#8217;  (in this case meaning <em>whenever</em>) may be used to form temporal clauses with the subjunctive.</p>

<blockquote><em>Pozb<em>í</em>šílá še parasolka tahatnit.</em><br>Whenever it rains, I bring my umbrella.</blockquote>

<h2>Perfective converb</h2>

<p>The perfective converb may also be used in temporal clauses. This usage, however, implies a greater causal relationship between the subordinate clause and the main clause.</p>

<blockquote><em>Blasa zahranu, mert na podveka vdenik.</em><br>When I entered the room, I saw the corpse lying on the floor.</p></blockquote>

<p>The imperfective may also be used (often with the conjunction <em>sim</em> in formal and literary registers).</p>

<blockquote><em>Otviec (sim) na Varšave možlašaní.</em><br>When I was young, we used to live in Warsaw.</blockquote>

<h2>With <em>niec, dnou </em>and <em>huzbá</em></h2>

<p>This third way of forming temporal clauses is specially useful when using the temporal clause not as an introduction to the main clause but as a modifier to an element in the sentence.</p>

<p><em>Niec, dnou </em>and <em>huzbá</em> are all nouns, and therefore the subordinate clause is first nominalised (if possible) and declined in the genitive, or otherwise connected to <em>niec, dnou</em> or <em>huzbá</em> with the linking particle <em>ko. Niec</em> &#8216;time&#8217; is generally the neutral choice. <em>Dnou </em>&#8216;front, before&#8217; is used when the situation/action being described is in the past and is most likely not true anymore while <em>huzbá</em> &#8216;back, after&#8217; is used when the situation is not true yet or the action is yet to happen.</p>


<blockquote><em>Za Léon Werthí me bylu dnou tóma hledébit.</em><br>I dedicate this book to Léon Werth, when he was still a young boy.<br><span style="margin-left: 15px;">(from <em>The Little Prince</em>)</span>
