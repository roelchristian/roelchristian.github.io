<h2><i>Punisher</i> &mdash; Phoebe Bridgers</h2>

<p>I first knew of Phoebe Bridgers as that punk girl with the silver-blond hair in the skeleton suit singing about payphones and 7/11s; that is to say, I first knew her from the bizarre<a href="https://youtu.be/Tw0zYd0eIlk">music video</a> for her single ‘Kyoto’ from midyear last year where she sings and screams (and dances) about love and late nights in a city on the other side of the globe over a cheap greenscreen in glorious 480p. It was a good song, and the music video was even better. But then again, as with most other artists who are at the top of their craft, ‘Kyoto’ for all its brilliance is not fully representative of the whole album and does not reflect the breadth of Phoebe Bridgers’ artistry.</p>

<p><i>Punisher</i> is a gloomy, if not depressive, album, not unlike <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>, the collection it followed. But there is a certain self-assuredness in its gloom, hope, even; and one emerges from listening to the album, aware of all the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phoebe-bridgers-punisher">horrors and possibilities</a> the world has in store, yet undaunted by them, plowing on. Playing the two albums back to back, one sees how Phoebe Bridgers has matured as an artist in the intervening time. While there are standout tracks from <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>, <i>Punisher</i> is a more cohesive record, with one song flowing to the other seemingly seamlessly, melded by Bridgers’ serene voice.</p>

<p>‘Garden Song,’ which opens the album (if one is to ignore the instrumental ‘DVD Menu’) sets the mood for the record, and is the most representative of the album as a whole in my opinion. In ‘Moon Song’</p>

<p><b>Favorite track:</b> ‘ICU’</p>
<p><b>Standout lyrics:</b> ‘You were screaming at the evangelicals/They were screaming right back from what I remember’ (‘Chinese Satellite’); ‘I hate your mom/ I hate it when she opens her mouth’ (‘ICU’)

<h2><i>Songs for Christmas</i> &mdash; Sufjan Stevens</h2>

Sufjan Stevens loves Christmas&mdash;and he wants you to know it, too. From 2001 he has published a new EP each year featuring his covers of Yuletide standards and even sometimes new songs. (‘Come On! Let’s Boogey to the Elf Dance!’ is something only the writer of ‘They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From the Dead!! Ahhhh!’ would have conceived.) The EPs were eventually compiled into two albums, <i>Songs for Christmas</i> (released in 2006) and <i>Silver &amp; Gold</i> (released in 2012).
