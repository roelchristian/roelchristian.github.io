I turn 22 today. Or yesterday. I don't know, Mischka, it seems pointless to count time or say I'm 22 now when in fact I have no idea what that means: I feel old, yes, and all the bones in my body are aching. I think 22 is a beautiful number: I'd echo Taylor but I have two decades more to wait before I could quote her with dignity. Today I've been the happiest I've been for quite a long time—until I remembered I had no one to share this happiness with, no one to talk to, no one to hug—weirdly I felt the need to hug somebody today and whisper in their ears: “I turn 22 now. I am very much alive, and I'm happy.” Thus begins a year I hope of making peace with myself and with life.
