I can’t remember the last time I spent Sunday morning on a sunny chair over some coffee and oranges, cracking the pastry slowly, as if careful not to break the inviolable hum of the late morning. Sometimes it would be with friends, invariably of the sort I know only superficially; but mostly I would be alone: it was the solitude, after all, that I was after. I haven’t had coffee outside in ages. I think I miss it, but unless it is cloudy, Manila at ten o’clock is rarely the perfect place for brunch, what with the warmth of the sun too quick to turn to a biting heat.

I saw a movie called _Operation Finale_ a week ago. Oscar Isaac was in it, whom I only know from _Inside Llewyn Davis_, perhaps the saddest movie I remember seeing. I don’t know what made me think the film would be in Hebrew. Ben Kingsley, who plays Eichmann, is too good an actor to play someone so notoriously _ordinary_. Even Kingsley’s stares are terrifying; which makes me wonder if they meant it consciously: an odd choice, if that were the case, seeing that the point of Eichmann is that he was unremarkable. Leonard Cohen once wrote of him: “What did you expect?/ Talons?/ Oversize incisors?/ Green saliva?/ Madness?”

We had dinner Saturday night at a newly-opened place in Legazpi; we entered out of frustration (mine, mainly) over the foiled plans from earlier that evening. We have passed by it once before, peeked at the clear glass, intrigued by how the soft melange of interior lights made it look like a bamboo forest. We didn't come in, that time, deciding the place looked too expensive. That it was a Saturday and the eve of a holiday, too, meant we could not get a ride; and I was too pissed off to walk.

The food was mediocre: I was more interested in the assortment of breads they served us after we sat down, especially the ones that looked like posh tree barks and had sesame seeds that popped when you bit them. I had a margarita, which I immediately regretted since it didn’t go well with any of the amuse-bouches. It could easily have ruined the evening were it not for the obnoxious party next to us, which provided us ample entertainment. We saw them enter one by one: first the family of four that looked thoroughly unremarkable, as if conjured straight from the pages of _Tatler_; then a gaunt man with the hair down his shoulder in a white Elvis Presley ensemble trailed by a girl in a racing green jacket and too much gold glitter; then another girl of about twenty dressed as a witch with half her face painted purple, followed by a man in a straw hat, an impeccably white shirt and a clean, crisp denim that absent the occasion would still have been unmistakable as a costume. It would have been a pity not to make fun of them.
