    <p>I was sent here at twenty</p>
    <p>Ut operaretur terram de qua sumptus sum,—</p>
    <p>And hiding in the indecipherability of my verses,</p>
    <p>Stood amber-eyed by the road that led to your city:</p>
    <p>I have long forgotten the message they bid me tell you</p>
    <p>Nor am I writing this du mon cachot with my greasy</p>
    <p>Hands and my greying eye to try to remember:</p>
    <p>I am past all pretense: I am mad at the world.</p>

    <p>In Éire, too, the kings have long fled their cities:</p>
    <p>And the people, too, have long forgotten their names:</p>
    <p>And the saints, foolish as God had made them, had stayed,</p>
    <p>Gregem gerendum, believing no time is too late for</p>
    <p>Salvation: I have never been to Hibernia, and my</p>
    <p>Father, and his father before him, had only known this</p>
    <p>City to be the world: and in their ignorance (as God had</p>
    <p>Made them) lived and loved and laughed and died inside</p>
    <p>Its walls: Oh that thou shouldst scoop the eyes out of this</p>
    <p>My skull and pull this my tongue with a forceps, as they had done</p>
    <p>Thee, Mother, nimica di ciascun crudele (or so thou hadst</p>
    <p>Them believe) and by this one act in Domini grege numerer.</p>

    <p>I have left behind the city of my birth where in the summer the</p>
    <p>Air was perfumed with mud and mango blossoms; the seashore</p>
    <p>Some thirty minutes from where I found myself living these</p>
    <p>Three years since I had left is rock-ribbed and smelled of piss.</p>
    <p>On the horizon I can see the white boats that lent the mise-en-scène</p>
    <p>Some respite from its own dullness: then farther, still, the littlest </p>
    <p>Hint of what remains of the countryside: an amorphous blob of</p>
    <p>Grey and green dotted by white. I have been here every week:</p>
    <p>Besides the food-truck that sold day-old food, under a palm tree</p>
    <p>Whose trunk some vandal had painted white, I have found</p>
    <p>The perfect place to cry.</p>

    <p>Who am I to wage war on God? Not that I ever believed that what</p>
    <p>Hibernian monster some fevered ninth-century dream had concocted</p>
    <p>Would have in the end led my brother to hang himself: or that</p>
    <p>He was weak (as their augurs had predicted) or that he was</p>
    <p>Unworthy (as their autopsy had revealed). I whispered my</p>
    <p>Diagnosis to my mother, nimica di ciascun crudele, (or so</p>
    <p>She had them believe), my raspy voice melting in the mechanical</p>
    <p>Hum of that March evening: à noite todos os gatos são—</p>
    <p>I was unable to utter the last word, ashamed, perhaps, trembling,</p>
    <p>Terrorized by how her brows arched perfectly, how her lips were</p>
    <p>Always hinting at a smile (but never did). We prayed, as good</p>
    <p>Christians did, nine days and nine nights, until his name was the</p>
    <p>Only one I remembered. The orange of the candlelight at dusk</p>
    <p>Before anyone had the mind to turn the lights on in the living-room</p>
    <p>Waltzed with the night’s purple in my mother’s face and mine.</p>
    <p>I almost understood what it meant to believe in God.</p>
