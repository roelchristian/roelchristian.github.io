<div class="epigraph">
  <div class="hangind">
  <p>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
  <p>prone to leave the God I love;
  <p>here's my heart, O take and seal it;
  <p>seal it for thy courts above.—

<p>Having grown in what is not your America, but
<p>Where the gods have names perverted from your cross;
<p>Having seen your forebears burn our villages,
<p>While their wives sing of the glory of your land,
<p>Mosquito-bitten, gap-toothed, almost surely a hypochondriac,
<p>I fashioned myself an affinity with you, Sufjan. We have grown
<p>Old together, Detroit boy: though the smog that colored your
<p>Childhood (o holy, holy) has yet to touch my sootfree skin:
<p>But my hunger is more visceral, Father. My mother is not an
<p>Alcoholic; also, she is alive; my father is, too: alive, but he an alcoholic.
<p>This is not to say,we were happy, or that I was happy, growing up:
<p>We were not: I decidedly was not: thus the affinity; thus the
<p>Romance I have fashioned between us two.—

<p>I was Christian once, and tried singing at church: I say it without the
<p>Nuance such declaration might conjure where you’re from:
<p>After all being Christian here (Catholic, if you ask me, your hand 
<p>Folded in defiance; but of course I will deny all that in a
<p>Heartbeat) is a mere accident of being, as inevitable as
<p>Breathing (or growing up among homophobes) while
<p>Singing is reserved for those whom God loved most (or so
<p>I was told). The songs were bad: maybe because we were not allowed to
<p>Sing about elves or reindeers (not that there were any here, or that
<p>Animals ever found refuge among this people), or because snow has
<p>Never fallen on any of the zinc roofs that lined the one road of this town,
<p>Or because,—maybe because,—we were just too tired of
<p>Having to manufacture happiness for four months. (Four months, and
<p>They ask us why some of us end up slinging a rope over a beam,
<p>Scratching the walls for imaginary rats, amidst such joy of joys!)
<p>My voice was worse than the songs ever were but I was happy,
<p>If happiness meant going to church with my grandmother on Christmas
<p>Or on my birthday, or on some other random day (St Marcellinus pray for us;
<p>St Agatha pray for us; St Athanasius pray for us; pray for us; pray for us).
<p>In Christmas we had lanterns, in the summer flowers; you would have
<p>Been happy here, Sufjan: or you would have ended up hating God, and
<p>Finding God hated you as well would sling a rope over a beam, &c. &c.—
