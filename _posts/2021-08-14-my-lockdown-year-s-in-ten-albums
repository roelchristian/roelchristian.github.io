<h2><i>Punisher</i> &mdash; Phoebe Bridgers</h2>

<p>I first knew of Phoebe Bridgers as that punk girl with the silver-blond hair in the skeleton suit singing about payphones and 7/11s; that is to say, I first knew her from the bizarre<a href="https://youtu.be/Tw0zYd0eIlk">music video</a> for her single ‘Kyoto’ from midyear last year where she sings and screams (and dances) about love and late nights in a city on the other side of the globe over a cheap greenscreen in glorious 480p. It was a good song, and the music video was even better. But then again, as with most other artists who are at the top of their craft, ‘Kyoto’ for all its brilliance is not fully representative of the whole album and does not reflect the breadth of Phoebe Bridgers’ artistry.</p>

<p><i>Punisher</i> is a gloomy, if not depressive, album, not unlike <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>, the collection it followed. But there is a certain self-assuredness in its gloom, hope, even; and one emerges from listening to the album, aware of all the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phoebe-bridgers-punisher">horrors and possibilities</a> the world has in store, yet undaunted by them, plowing on. Playing the two albums back to back, one sees how Phoebe Bridgers has matured as an artist in the intervening time. While there are standout tracks from <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>, <i>Punisher</i> is a more cohesive record, with one song flowing to the other seemingly seamlessly, melded by Bridgers’ serene voice.</p>

<p>‘Garden Song,’ which opens the album (if one is to ignore the instrumental ‘DVD Menu’) sets the mood for the record, and is the most representative of the album as a whole in my opinion. In ‘Moon Song’</p>

<p>‘I Know the End,’ the album’s best track</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite track:</b> ‘ICU’</p>
<p><b>Standout lyrics:</b> ‘You were screaming at the evangelicals/They were screaming right back from what I remember’ (‘Chinese Satellite’); ‘I hate your mom/ I hate it when she opens her mouth’ (‘ICU’)

<h2><i>Blue</i> &mdash; Joni Mitchell</h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">‘Both Sides Now’ was the first song by Joni MItchell I remember hearing: and although I did like the song, I didn’t quite like her version of it at first, preferring Judy Collins’ more upbeat cover to Joni’s original. Then there was ‘Big Yellow Taxi,’ a surprisingly catchy tune whose indelible Summer of Love roots would have made it easy for anyone to dismiss it as just another hippie anthem. Had those been the only songs by Joni Mitchell I’ve heard, I would have considered her as just another folk singer/songwriter whose songs I occasionally would listen to, but</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But things changed when I heard </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In some ways, 2020 for me was the year of Joni Mitchell. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.hl6osrunc3h4"><span class="c4">Malibu</span><span class="c10 c7">&nbsp;- Anderson .Paak</span></h1><h1 class="c1" id="h.8uboj4tf2zjw"><span class="c4">How I’m Feeling Now </span><span class="c10 c7">- Charli XCX</span></h1><h1 class="c1" id="h.o692y2bfctxs"><span class="c4">Be the Cowboy </span><span class="c7 c10">- Mitski</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.dnrg9ca9mhe"><span class="c4">Rumors </span><span class="c10 c7">- Fleetwood Mac</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.6zga5pnauc23"><span class="c4">Folklore </span><span class="c10 c7">- Taylor Swift</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c14">For a lot of us, </span><span class="c12">Folklore </span><span class="c0">was the lockdown album</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.lz02li6zy3fr"><span class="c4">Songs for Christmas </span><span class="c10 c7">- Sufjan Stevens</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c14">Sufjan Stevens loves Christmas and he wants you to know it.
