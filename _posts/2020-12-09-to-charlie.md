title: "To Charlie, who died before we could be friends"
---

Should I call you brother, child or friend? I knew of you only when you died.
Before that you were just a name, my life a catalogue of names like yours, &
sometimes when I’m lucky, of faces (how I wish now I remembered yours) —But then
you died & the universe started talking in your voice & at first I thought I was
getting mad but how could I get madder than I already was. —& the voices kept me
nights thinking of the life wasted in not knowing you & the voices did not die
down & I learned silence is but an illusion & so is everything. Said Milton: the
mind is its own place (I only believe in priests & blind men & he was both) &
slowly I managed to banish the voices by playing games with myself where I can
never win & only lose. —But the universe is talking again, Charlie. This time
the voice is louder, though the voice is still yours. Help me: I’d like to think
this was your fault.
