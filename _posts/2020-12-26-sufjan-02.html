I was sent here at twenty<p>
Ut operaretur terram de qua sumptus sum,—<p>
And hiding in the indecipherability of my verses,<p>
Stood amber-eyed by the road that led to your city:<p>
I have long forgotten the message they bid me tell you<p>
Nor am I writing this du mon cachot with my greasy<p>
Hands and my greying eye to try to remember:<p>
I am past all pretense: I am mad at the world.

In Éire, too, the kings have long fled their cities:<p>
The saints, foolish as God had made them, had stayed,<p>
Gregem gerendum, believing no time is too late for<p>
Salvation: I have never been to Hibernia, and my<p>
Father, and his father before him, had only known this<p>
City to be the world: and in their ignorance (as God had<p>
Made them) lived and loved and laughed and died inside<p>
Its walls: Oh that thou shouldst scoop the eyes out of this<p>
My skull and pull this my tongue with a forceps, as they had done<p>
Thee, Mother, nimica di ciascun crudele (or so thou hadst<p>
Them believe) and by this one act in Domini grege numerer.<p>

I have left behind the city of my birth where in the summer the<p>
Air was perfumed with mud and mango blossoms; the seashore<p>
Some thirty minutes from where I found myself living these<p>
Three years since I had left is rock-ribbed and smelled of piss.<p>
On the horizon I can see the white boats that lent the mise-en-scène<p>
Some respite from its own dullness: then farther, still, the littlest <p>
Hint of what remains of the countryside: an amorphous blob of<p>
Grey and green dotted by white. I have been here every week:<p>
Beside the food-truck that sold day-old food, under a palm tree<p>
Whose trunk some vandal had painted white, I have found<p>
The perfect place to cry.

Who am I to wage war on God? Not that I ever believed that what<p>
Hibernian monster some fevered ninth-century dream had concocted<p>
Would have in the end led my brother to hang himself: or that<p>
He was weak (as their augurs had predicted) or that he was<p>
Unworthy (as their autopsy had revealed). I whispered my<p>
Diagnosis to my mother, nimica di ciascun crudele, (or so<p>
She had them believe), my raspy voice melting into the mechanical<p>
Hum of that March evening: à noite todos os gatos são—<p>
I was unable to utter the last word, ashamed, perhaps, trembling,<p>
Terrorized by how her brows arched perfectly, how her lips were<p>
Always hinting at a smile (but never did). We prayed, as good<p>
Christians did, nine days and nine nights, until his name was the<p>
Only one I remembered. The orange of the candlelight at dusk<p>
Before anyone had the mind to turn the lights on in the living-room<p>
Waltzed with the night’s purple in my mother’s face and mine.<p>
I almost understood what it meant to believe in God.<p>
