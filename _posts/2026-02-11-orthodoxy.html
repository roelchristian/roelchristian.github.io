        Yesterday I was listening to an <a href="https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2025/02/12/episode-318-orthodox-questions-with-father-john-strickland-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode</a> of Robin Pierson's <em>History of Byzantium</em> featuring a conversation between the host and Rev. John Strickland, an Orthodox priest and scholar, on some of the more common questions touching Orthodoxy as it is practised and understood by its faithful. Although I possess some general acquaintance with their beliefs and their liturgy — bearing in mind, of course, that for almost a millennium the Orthodox and the Catholic shared the same apostolic faith, and judging moreover, if I may speak with candour, that the divergences which issued in schism appear, when viewed across the longer tract of time and at the distance of several centuries, to have depended more upon politics and the contingencies of history than upon theology, or at the very least to have been aggravated rather by geographical separation and by the politics of the age — I remain, unfortunately, no more than this: an outsider, neither myself Orthodox nor a scholar of Orthodoxy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of that exchange I retain in memory two points in particular: the first, concerning soteriology, namely that — when speaking of faith and salvation — the Catholics, Strickland argues, are more inclined toward legalisms and fine distinctions, whereas the Orthodox are more content to leave the matter within the precincts of mystery, so much so that the polemical disputes of the Reformation, being rooted in the legalistic idiom that developed in the West after the schism, remain largely alien to the Orthodox mind; the second, concerning purgatory, which the Orthodox reject, together with the Orthodox notion of aerial toll-houses, of which I recall having heard before, and which Strickland is careful to clarify as not, strictly speaking, a doctrine in its own right, but rather a pious opinion, <span lang="gk">θεολογούμενον</span>. Of this latter point, however, I shall make little occasion to speak at present, both because the Orthodox rejection of purgatory may be understood as a consequence of their account of salvation (to which I shall shortly return in greater detail), and because my own notice of aerial toll-houses has been only incidental, my curiosity having been piqued in the first place by what had seemed to me a curious and, if one may say so, rather eccentric belief.
    </p>
    <p>
        He maintains, first, that Orthodoxy does not, properly speaking, enter into the post-Reformation controversy habitually framed as “faith alone” versus “faith plus works,” for the simple reason that the controversy itself presupposes a juridical and increasingly legalistic idiom which, he contends, came to govern Western — indeed, specifically Catholic — theological reflection in the centuries that followed the rupture with Constantinople; and he adds, by way of consequence, that the Orthodox account of salvation is better rendered, not in forensic categories, but under the rubric of theosis (deification). Yet this is not deification in the sense sometimes imputed to the Latter-day Saints, as though man were to become god in an autonomous or self-originating manner (a heresy, if there ever was one), but rather the creature’s gracious participation in the divine life, a participation flowing from — and rendered possible by — the Incarnation itself. Faith and works, therefore, do not admit of any neat disjunction: salvation is theosis; salvation is by grace, not by human “merit”; and faith, precisely by its own nature, must disclose itself in works of love — not as though works were a competing “currency” set alongside faith, but as the enacted and lived form in which faith subsists (cf. Jas 2:17, 26).
        </p>
        <p>
            That posture, I add, is not without a recognisably Catholic analogue; yet the polarity “faith alone” versus “faith and works,” as it is often prosecuted — and as Strickland presents it as the characteristic Western polemic — appears to presuppose a distinctly pre-Second Vatican Council legal framework, one which many contemporary Catholic theologians would argue no longer constitutes the Church’s primary mode of self-understanding. It is in that light, perhaps, that his depiction of Catholic soteriology as a sequence of “transactions” — of indulgences and penances, for example, with a glance toward the indulgence controversy that propelled Martin Luther’s Ninety-Five Theses into notoriety — ought to be read: as an attempt to name, in historical relief, a grammar of salvation cast in quasi-commercial terms. Modern Catholic teaching, by contrast — especially as articulated in the ecumenical dialogues exemplified by the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification between the Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation — has insisted that salvation is a free gift of grace: indeed, the Declaration famously speaks of “by grace alone,” received in faith in Christ’s saving work and not on account of any merit on our part; which is, in substance, what the cleric insists the Orthodox brethren likewise confess. His proem, in effect, is this: before one can profitably dispute faith versus works, one must first settle what it is that one means by “salvation.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Accordingly, he defines the “economy of salvation” in participatory terms: theosis, a real participation in the life of God, made possible because Christ has assumed human nature in the Incarnation — because God has become man — and secured, in his telling, by the dogmatic settlement of the Council of Chalcedon and by the two-natures Christology classically associated with Leo the Great. Once salvation is conceived chiefly as a legal status — acquittal rather than condemnation — the question, “what effects acquittal: faith or works?”, arises with a kind of inevitability, because the governing metaphor itself invites one to parse causes, conditions, and instruments within a forensic scheme. If, however, salvation is conceived as transformative union or participation — namely, theosis — then the very contrast “faith versus works” becomes, in his judgement, a mistake in categories: it asks after a causal sequence internal to a juridical figure precisely where the governing account is not forensic but participatory.
    </p>
    <p>
       He therefore begins with the Incarnation and theosis, since this point of departure secures a participatory — rather than a juridical — construal of salvation. On such a participatory account, salvation is conceived not as an external adjudication but as a mode of communion and participation; and precisely for that reason the familiar question “what secures the verdict?” does not present itself with the same inevitability, because the controlling grammar is not that of acquittal, liability, and satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
       By contrast, he contends, “Western” Christianity, by its characteristic habits of thought, tends to gravitate toward the Crucifixion and, at times, to treat it in a comparatively isolated manner. For once the Cross is construed chiefly as a transaction intended to resolve a determinate liability — whether described as guilt, punishment, or debt — salvation is, with some inevitability, redescribed in forensic and legal categories: justification as verdict, together with the attendant language of guilt and remission, satisfaction and penalty, and the like. Within that conceptual register, moreover, a further inquiry presses forward almost of its own accord: what, precisely, secures the verdict — faith alone, or faith conjoined with works; and if works are introduced, are they to be understood as meritorious, instrumental, merely evidential, or otherwise? It is within this horizon, he suggests, that the Protestant Reformation, the indulgence controversy, and the Ninety-Five Theses are best grasped — not as isolated eruptions, but as exemplary crystallizations of a deeper faith–works polemic generated by the underlying transactional frame.
    </p>
    <p>
Accordingly, on his account, the faith–works dispute is less a first-order controversy than the symptom of a prior and more fundamental alteration in the governing model of salvation: where a participatory account presides, the dispute fails to arise in the same form or to assume the same urgency; where a forensic or transactional account predominates, the dispute readily becomes central.
    </p>
    <p>
With respect to his claims, the Catholic faith concurs, first, that the Incarnation is not a merely incidental prelude to redemption but is constitutive of God’s salvific counsel, inasmuch as Catholic teaching expressly affirms that the Word became flesh in order that we might become “partakers of the divine nature,” that is, that we might truly share, by grace, in God’s own life. He is likewise correct that certain strands of Western preaching — especially at the popular level, and most of all in polemical presentations — can at times leave the impression that “the Cross is basically the whole story”; yet, as an account of Catholic doctrine, this impression is misleading, for the Church understands the one work of salvation as embracing Incarnation, Cross, and Resurrection in their proper order and mutual coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
This is confirmed by the Church’s own doctrinal formulations. Catholic doctrine states, indeed, that “Redemption comes to us above all through the blood of his cross,” (CCC 517) while insisting at the same time that the mystery of redemption is “at work throughout Christ’s entire life,” (<em>ibid.</em>) and therefore cannot be confined to a single episode abstracted from the rest of Christ’s saving economy, but includes the Incarnation and the Resurrection as integral moments within the one salvific act. Nor does the centrality of the Paschal mystery — Cross and Resurrection — in apostolic proclamation stand in tension with this wider affirmation; rather, it is precisely as the culminating disclosure of a redemption already operative throughout the whole course of Christ’s life that it occupies the centre. If, therefore, the criticism is that Catholics doctrinally isolate the crucifixion as though there were little else, the proper reply is that such a claim misrepresents the Church’s own teaching, which refuses to sever Calvary from the Incarnation that renders it salvific and from the Resurrection that manifests its victorious efficacy. The more accurate contrast, it seems to me, is not that “the West forgets the Incarnation,” but that the dominant idiom differs: Catholic theology typically works with multiple registers — participation, sacrifice, satisfaction, victory, adoption — whereas Orthodoxy more habitually leads with participation, healing, and theosis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, when he says that participation in God’s life occurs in a way “not possible under any other circumstances,” I grant the point, insofar as Christianity is uniquely Incarnational. Yet Catholics themselves explicitly teach divinisation as one purpose of the Incarnation, again in the language of becoming “partakers of the divine nature,” (CCC 460) and even in the patristic idiom of “becoming God,” (<em>ibid.,</em> citing St. Athanasius, <em>De incarnatione</em> 54, 3: PG 25, 192B.) understood, however, as grace by participation and not as autonomous deification. On this point, then, Catholic doctrine does not dissent, but rather discloses, beneath differing emphases of presentation, a shared patristic inheritance plainly in view.
    </p>
    <p>
       Catholic doctrine on faith and works cannot be adequately described by the assertion that we are “saved by works,” if “works” are construed as independent inputs by which one secures justification. Catholic doctrine repudiates the thesis “you justify yourself by your works” no less decisively than any other Christian confession, insisting that justification is the effect of divine grace through Jesus Christ, and that works follow as the necessary fruit of a living faith rather than as its competing cause. The Council of Trent explicitly condemns the claim that one can be justified “by his own works … without the grace of God through Jesus Christ”; and the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification — issued by the Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation — confesses together: “By grace alone… not because of any merit on our part.” Works, on this account, are “neither the basis of justification nor merit it,” and therefore the inference that “Catholic” simply means “works-based” fails to correspond to the Church’s doctrinal self-description.
    </p>

    <p>
        The term at which interlocutors most often speak past one another is “merit.” Catholic teaching does employ the language of merit, and to Orthodox ears such diction can readily sound like juridical earning; yet Catholic doctrine is careful to attribute human merit, in the first instance, to God’s grace, and only secondarily to the person’s graced cooperation. What is at issue, then, is not Pelagian “earning,” but the attempt to safeguard at once God’s sovereign initiative and the reality that God “crowns His own gifts” in us — real transformation and real cooperation, without any insinuation of autonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
Indulgences are indeed relevant as a Reformation flashpoint; yet the theological account requires precision, and the historical catalyst must be distinguished from the doctrinal claim. Historically, the indulgence controversy did serve as a catalyst for Martin Luther and his Ninety-Five Theses, thereby sharpening the faith–works polemic. Doctrinally, however, an indulgence concerns temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven; and the Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly cautions that such “punishments” are not to be conceived as external vengeance imposed by God, but as consequences flowing from sin’s nature and from the need for purification, whether in this life or after death. Accordingly, while abuses and disordered pastoral practice existed (and were condemned and reformed), indulgences should not be construed as a “works mechanism” substituting for faith; within Catholic doctrine they presuppose forgiveness and are ordered to repentance and charity.
    </p>
    <p>
        In sum, the preface by Rev. Strickland and his subsequent arguments — Incarnation, then theosis — are plainly intended to displace a courtroom model (verdict, payment) in favour of a communion-and-transformation model (participation, healing); and, from a Catholic standpoint, that shift is not alien, since we affirm both divinisation and redemption as operative throughout Christ’s life. The substantive disagreement, as I would frame it, is not “Incarnation versus Cross,” but rather which conceptual grammar ought to govern, and how later Western terms — justification, satisfaction, merit, purgatory, indulgences — are to be construed and hedged against caricature.
