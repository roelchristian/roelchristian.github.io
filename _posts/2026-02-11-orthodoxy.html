    <p>
        Yesterday I was listening to an <a
        href="https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2025/02/12/episode-318-orthodox-questions-with-father-john-strickland-part-1/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode</a> of Robin Pierson's
        <em>History of Byzantium</em> featuring a conversation between the host
        and Rev. John Strickland, an Orthodox priest and scholar, on some of the
        more common questions touching Orthodoxy as it is practised and
        understood by its faithful. Although I possess some general acquaintance
        with their beliefs and their liturgy — bearing in mind, of course, that
        for nearly a millennium the Orthodox and the Catholic shared the same
        apostolic faith, and judging moreover, if I may speak with candour, that
        the divergences which issued in schism appear, when viewed across the
        longer tract of time and from the remove of several centuries, to have
        depended more upon politics and the contingencies of history than upon
        theology; or at the very least, without downplaying whatever real
        theological differences arose and continue to separate the two churches,
        to have been exacerbated rather by geographical separation and by the
        politics of the age — I remain, alas, no more than this: an outsider,
        neither myself Orthodox nor a scholar of Orthodoxy.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>1. Strickland’s thesis</h2>
        <p>
        Of that exchange I retain in memory two points in particular. The first
        concerns soteriology: when speaking of faith and salvation, Strickland
        contends that the Catholic West became increasingly habituated to
        legalisms and fine distinctions, whereas the Orthodox are more content
        to leave certain matters within the province of mystery; so much so that
        the polemical disputes of the Reformation—habitually framed as “faith
        alone” versus “faith plus works”—remain largely alien to the Orthodox
        mind, precisely because (on his account) those disputes presuppose a
        juridical idiom that developed in the West after the schism. The second
        concerns purgatory, which the Orthodox reject; and he mentions as well
        the Orthodox notion of aerial toll-houses—something I recall having
        heard before—which he is careful to qualify as not, strictly speaking, a
        doctrine in its own right, but rather a pious opinion, a <span
        lang="gk">θεολογούμενον</span>.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The core of Strickland’s argument, however, is not an excursus on
        post-mortem states but a proposal about the very grammar of salvation.
        He maintains, first, that Orthodoxy does not, properly speaking, enter
        into the post-Reformation controversy so often prosecuted as “faith
        alone” versus “faith and works,” for the simple reason that the
        controversy itself is born within a Western polemical field and tends to
        be carried on in a forensic key: justification as verdict, salvation as
        acquittal, penance and satisfaction as liabilities and remissions.
        Orthodoxy, he says  if pressed to speak into that debate, will certainly
        insist upon faith in Jesus Christ as central and indispensable; yet it
        will resist any neat disjunction between faith and works, since the two
        are not competing currencies but inseparable aspects of a single life in
        Christ. </p>
    <p>
        Accordingly, Strickland renders the Orthodox account of salvation not in
        forensic categories but under the rubric of <em>theosis</em>
        (deification): not deification in the sense sometimes imputed to the
        Latter-day Saints, as though man were to become god in an autonomous or
        self-originating manner (a heresy, if there ever was one), but rather
        the creature’s gracious participation in the divine life, a
        participation flowing from, and rendered possible by, the Incarnation
        itself. Because the Word has assumed human nature, humanity can, by
        grace, be made a participant in God’s own life. Faith and works
        therefore do not admit of any clean separation: faith, precisely by its
        own nature, must disclose itself in works of love—not as though works
        were an additional mechanism set alongside faith, but as the enacted
        form in which faith subsists.
    </p>
    <p> 
        From this starting-point Strickland draws a contrast of emphases.
        Orthodoxy, he suggests, is more decisively centred on the Incarnation as
        the foundation of salvation, whereas Western Christianity tends to
        gravitate toward the Crucifixion and, at times, to treat it in a
        comparatively isolated manner. Once the Cross is construed chiefly as a
        transaction intended to resolve a determinate liability—whether
        described as guilt, punishment, or debt—salvation is readily redescribed
        in legal categories; and within that register the familiar question
        “what secures the verdict?” naturally forces its way to the front: faith
        alone, or faith together with works; and if works are introduced, are
        they meritorious, instrumental, merely evidential, and so forth? It is
        within this horizon, he suggests, that the indulgence controversy and
        the Reformation disputes are best grasped—not merely as historical
        accidents, but as crystallizations of a deeper polemical tension
        generated by a narrowed, transactional frame. </p>
    <p>
        That, at least, is the thesis as I heard it: theosis and Incarnation are
        not merely <em>topics</em> within soteriology, but the proper point of
        departure, precisely because they set the whole matter within a
        participatory model (communion, transformation, healing), rather than a
        courtroom model (verdict, payment, satisfaction). The Orthodox rejection
        of purgatory then follows, on his account, as one downstream
        implication: purgatory appears to belong to a juridical soteriology in
        which salvation is construed as remission of penalties and post-mortem
        purification as the completion of a legal satisfaction.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>   
        <h2>2. The “forensic versus participatory” opposition is too simple</h2>
    <p>
        Strickland’s instinct here is not without force. Anyone who has listened
        to popular Western preaching, or read certain late-medieval devotional
        materials, will recognise how easily the language of “debt,” “payment,”
        and “punishment” can become a quasi-commercial imagination of
        redemption. And once such a construal becomes dominant, the faith–works
        dispute can indeed feel almost inevitable: if salvation is primarily a
        verdict, what conditions attach to the verdict? If penalties remain, how
        are they discharged? If remission may be obtained, by what means? In
        this sense, Strickland’s critique can be heard as an objection, not to
        biblical language as such, but to a <em>reduction</em>—to the tendency
        to let one metaphor harden into a single controlling model. </p> <p> Yet
        the remedy cannot be to oppose “juridical” to “participatory” as though
        the former were intrinsically Western, late, or legalistic, and the
        latter uniquely Eastern, patristic, or spiritual. The Christian sources
        themselves are already pluriform. The apostolic writings speak at once
        in forensic terms (<em>justification</em>, <em>condemnation</em>,
        acquittal, judgment), in cultic terms (sacrifice, offering, priesthood),
        in familial terms (adoption, inheritance), in medicinal terms (healing,
        illumination), and in participatory terms (union with Christ, life in
        the Spirit, incorporation into the Body). This is not an embarrassment
        to be tidied away; it is a feature of the scriptural witness. The
        economy of salvation is too vast to be exhausted by any single image.
        </p>
    <p>
        St Paul, in particular, speaks unabashedly in juridical accents: he
        contrasts condemnation and justification; he speaks of God as judge; he
        deploys the language of law and verdict. At the same time, the very same
        Pauline corpus is saturated with participatory and transformative
        claims: the Christian is “in Christ”; Christ lives in the believer; the
        old man dies and a new creation arises; believers are incorporated into
        one body, animated by one Spirit; they are conformed to Christ, not
        merely declared his. The juridical and the participatory are not rival
        soteriologies in Paul, but concurrent registers within one proclamation.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Precisely here one can locate the point at which an irenic Catholic
        clarification is most needed. The Catholic tradition does not deny,
        still less despise, the participatory horizon that Strickland calls
        theosis. It confesses divinisation, speaks of sanctifying grace as a
        real share in God’s life, and treats salvation as incorporation into
        Christ and transformation by the Spirit. But neither can it simply
        renounce forensic language, because such language is not a medieval
        invention: it is apostolic. The question, then, is not whether juridical
        terminology may be employed, but whether it is allowed to become a
        self-sufficient and flattening scheme—whether “verdict” is made to
        exclude “communion,” or “acquittal” is made to replace “new life.”
        </p> <p> Put differently: the deepest problem is not “juridical
        categories,” but <em>legalism</em>—and legalism is not identical with
        the mere use of judicial metaphors. A court may declare what is already
        the case; but God’s judgment, in the Christian proclamation, is not
        merely descriptive. When God justifies, he does not merely label: he
        effects what he declares, because grace is not only pardon but power,
        not only remission but renewal. To insist upon this is not to capitulate
        to a Western rationalism; it is to preserve the biblical sense that
        divine speech is creative and efficacious. The real target, therefore,
        is any “transactional” construal that abstracts verdict from vitality,
        or liability from communion, or satisfaction from sanctification. </p>
   <p> Once this is granted, the terrain shifts. Strickland is right to warn against a construal of salvation as a ledger of debts and payments. But it does not follow that forensic language is alien to the apostolic mind, or that the West is doomed to legalism simply by speaking of justification and judgment. Rather, the question becomes: what is the proper ordering of the biblical metaphors, and what safeguards prevent any one of them from tyrannising the whole? It is that question—about the controlling grammar and the necessary guardrails—that will allow a clearer assessment of theosis and Incarnation on the one hand, and of faith, works, satisfaction, and purgatory on the other. </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>3. Theosis and the Incarnation</h2>

  <p>
    Having said that the opposition between “forensic” and “participatory” is too simple, it is worth underscoring what is best and most fruitful in Strickland’s point of departure. Theosis—participation in the divine life—is not a speculative flourish at the margins of Orthodox piety; it is the native way in which many Eastern fathers speak of salvation, and it draws directly upon the scriptural promise that we are made “partakers of the divine nature.” In that sense, Strickland is surely right to insist that “salvation” cannot be reduced to a change of status, as though God merely reclassified the sinner by an external decree; rather, salvation names a new life: communion with God, transformation by grace, and incorporation into Christ.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a Catholic standpoint, this emphasis is not foreign. Catholic teaching not only permits but positively <em>requires</em> a participatory account of salvation. The Catechism speaks without ambiguity of the Incarnation’s purpose in divinising terms: “The Word became flesh to make us ‘partakers of the divine nature’” (CCC 460), and it even adopts, with due qualification, the patristic idiom that God became man “so that we might become God”—that is, by grace and participation, not by nature or autonomy. If this is true, then theosis is not merely an “Orthodox distinctive” set over against Catholic soteriology, but part of the common patristic inheritance, expressed with different accents and preferred vocabularies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This immediately corrects one possible misimpression in Strickland’s presentation. If the question is whether Catholicism knows an account of salvation as participation, the answer is plainly yes. If the question is rather why Eastern theology tends to lead with that register more habitually, while Western theology often gives prominent place to juridical and sacrificial idioms, then we are dealing less with a contradiction than with a difference of rhetorical and theological prioritisation. Orthodoxy commonly begins with communion and transfiguration, and then situates the Cross within that horizon; the West, especially in polemical periods, has often begun with guilt and reconciliation, and then sought to secure transformation within that framework. Both can be orthodox; both can also become reductive if detached from the other registers that Scripture itself supplies.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also seems to me that Strickland’s “Incarnation versus Cross” contrast is best treated as a caution about imbalance rather than as a doctrinal diagnosis. Catholic doctrine is clear that the Incarnation is not a mere preliminary scene set before “the real work” of redemption begins. The Catechism says that “the mystery of Christ’s Redemption is at work in a hidden way throughout his entire life” and yet “comes to us above all through the blood of his cross” (CCC 517). The point is not to dilute the Cross, but to refuse to sever it from the Incarnation that renders it salvific and from the Resurrection that manifests its victory. The Cross is not isolated because it is not self-standing: it is the climactic disclosure of a single economy in which God unites humanity to himself and heals it from within.
  </p>

  <p>
    If this is granted, one can preserve what is strongest in Strickland’s argument without conceding what is overstated. He is right to want salvation to be understood as transformative union rather than as mere acquittal. Catholics can agree—and indeed insist—that salvation involves real incorporation into Christ and real sanctification by grace. The point of clarification is simply that the Church does not need to choose between these: the juridical and sacrificial language of Scripture is meant to serve, not supplant, the participatory end for which humanity is created—communion with God.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>

  <h2>4. Faith, works, “transaction,” and purgatory</h2>

  <p>
    With this groundwork laid, the perennial faith–works question can be handled with greater precision and less heat. Strickland is right that the popular polemic—“Protestants say faith alone, Catholics say faith plus works”—often functions as a caricature, one that can be sustained only by treating “works” as independent inputs by which a person purchases justification. Catholic doctrine does not teach this. It repudiates the idea that a person can justify himself by his own works apart from grace. Whatever legitimate disagreements persist about the best way to describe justification’s interior dynamics, the Catholic Church’s own doctrinal self-description insists that justification is a gift: grace precedes, grace enables, grace sustains.
  </p>

  <p>
    The more exact Catholic claim is that faith is never meant to remain a bare, inert assent; it is ordered to become living faith—faith “working through love”—and the works that follow are not a competing cause alongside grace, but the fruit and manifestation of grace’s efficacy. If one asks whether salvation is “by faith” or “by works,” the Catholic answer is that salvation is by grace through faith, and that the same grace that justifies also renovates and empowers charity. In other words, the dispute becomes less confusing once one separates three questions that are often collapsed into one: (i) what is the cause of justification (grace alone), (ii) what is faith (living trust, not mere acknowledgment), and (iii) what is the place of works (not purchase, but participation; not currency, but consequence and cooperation).
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point, the term “merit” tends to become the stumbling-block. Catholic teaching does employ the language of merit, and to Orthodox ears it can sound like juridical earning. But the intention is not Pelagian autonomy. The Church’s point is rather to safeguard two truths at once: that God is the sovereign author of salvation, and that the human person is not saved as a stone is moved, but as a living agent renewed by grace and enabled to cooperate. If there is “merit,” it is derivative: God crowns his own gifts. This is precisely why Catholic doctrine simultaneously denies that merit originates in man and yet speaks of a true reward, since the reward is God’s free completion of what his grace has begun.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is also the place to treat the “transactional” imagery that Strickland critiques. His criticism finds an easy target in periods when Western preaching and penitential practice were described in ledger-like terms: debts, satisfactions, remissions, and (especially in abuses) indulgences spoken of as though they were spiritual commodities. Catholics have no interest in defending those distortions. The question is what the Church means, doctrinally, when she uses such terms. The Catechism’s own guardrails are strikingly non-commercial: it describes the “punishments” of sin not as external acts of divine vengeance but as consequences that follow from sin’s nature and from the disorder it introduces—hence the need for purification, healing, and detachment. Within that framework indulgences, whatever one thinks of their historical administration, presuppose forgiveness and repentance; they are not substitutes for faith, but ecclesial acts ordered (in principle) to conversion and charity, and they were repeatedly reformed precisely because the Church recognised how easily the practice could be misunderstood and abused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Purgatory belongs to the same zone of misunderstanding. Strickland rejects it as the expression of an overly juridical soteriology—a post-mortem penal system for discharging liabilities. Here one must distinguish medieval imaginative literature and popular representations from the doctrinal core. The Catholic claim is not that the saved are “basically in hell for a while,” nor that purgatory is a second damnation. Rather, the Church teaches a final purification of those who die in God’s friendship yet remain imperfectly healed and detached from sin. The point is not to compete with theosis but, in a certain sense, to protect it: if salvation is real transformation, then the logic of purification—whether completed in this life or, by God’s mercy, beyond—follows. Where Orthodox theology may prefer to leave the post-mortem manner of this healing within the realm of mystery and pious opinion, Catholicism has given the claim a more determinate dogmatic articulation. The disagreement, then, is not simply “purification versus no purification,” but how far one can or should define the manner of that purification and how to prevent definition from degenerating into imagery of terror or payment.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is also worth noting, in an ecumenical spirit, that the instinct behind purgatory is not altogether alien to the East: the practice of praying for the departed and entrusting them to God’s mercy presupposes that what remains incomplete in us may yet be healed by God. Catholics and Orthodox diverge in how they conceptualise and define the post-mortem state; they do not diverge in confessing that God perfects his saints and that holiness is not a mere legal fiction. That shared conviction is precisely why the argument needs to be framed with care, so that real disagreements are not inflated by misunderstandings.
  </p>
  </section>
    <section>

  <h2>5. An aside on “mystery” and the West</h2>

  <p>
    One further point deserves mention, because it often lurks beneath these comparisons. Strickland contrasts an Orthodox comfort with mystery to Western habits of juridical distinction. There is something true here, at least as a description of style: Eastern theology has, in many of its dominant voices, a pronounced apophatic restraint and a preference for liturgical and doxological expression, whereas the Latin tradition has often shown a taste for analytic precision and conceptual differentiation. Yet it would be a mistake to infer from this that the West is “mystery-averse,” or that distinction-making necessarily implies rationalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Western tradition, too, is saturated with apophatic sensibility: it insists upon divine incomprehensibility, the limits of human language, and the necessity of analogy. Its scholastic method—at its best—was never meant to dissolve mystery but to clear away confusions that impede contemplation. One need not romanticise the medieval schools to observe that their most careful practitioners distinguished precisely in order to prevent crude literalism and to protect what cannot be comprehended. The West’s great mystical line—one thinks of the anonymous author of <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em>, or of John of the Cross and Teresa of Ávila—hardly betrays an allergy to mystery. And the Church’s sacramental life, no less in the Latin rite than in the Byzantine, remains a continual pedagogy of the visible bearing the invisible, of sign and reality held together without being collapsed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps the most charitable way to put the matter is this: the two traditions have often developed different temperaments of expression. The danger in the Western temperament is reduction—turning metaphors into mechanisms, or allowing juridical language to eclipse communion. The danger in the Eastern temperament, if it is caricatured or misused, can be a suspicion of precision as such, as though clarity were always a betrayal of mystery. In truth, mystery and clarity are not enemies. Christian doctrine is not an attempt to comprehend God exhaustively, but an attempt to confess truly what God has revealed, in such a way that worship is guarded from distortion and salvation is proclaimed without confusion.
  </p>


</section>
<section>

  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Strickland’s proem—Incarnation, then theosis—is plainly intended to displace a narrowed courtroom model (verdict, payment, satisfaction) in favour of a communion-and-transformation model (participation, healing). On that fundamental point, a Catholic can readily concur. The Word truly became flesh that we might become “partakers of the divine nature”; grace is not merely pardon but power; salvation is not only a change of standing but a new life in Christ. If parts of Western preaching or devotional culture have sometimes given the impression that salvation is a matter of spiritual accounting, the critique is not without a real object, and Catholics need not deny the historical pathologies that made such caricatures plausible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where clarification is needed is in the implied opposition between “participatory East” and “juridical West,” as though the latter were intrinsically legalistic or essentially post-schism. The Christian sources themselves speak in multiple registers. Scripture—Paul above all—employs judicial metaphors without embarrassment, while simultaneously proclaiming a thoroughly participatory and transformative salvation: incorporation into Christ, life in the Spirit, conformity to the Son. The issue, therefore, is not whether forensic language may be used, but whether any one register is permitted to tyrannise the whole—whether verdict is abstracted from communion, whether satisfaction is detached from sanctification, whether “punishment” language is severed from its true aim in purification and healing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Read with those guardrails in view, much of Strickland’s critique can be received as a warning against reduction rather than as a verdict against Catholic doctrine itself. Catholic teaching, taken on its own terms, is not “faith plus works” in the sense of a competitive addition, nor is it a denial of theosis. It insists that justification is sheer gift, effected by grace through Christ; that faith, if genuine, becomes living faith through charity; that works are the fruit and the graced cooperation of the renewed person rather than an independent currency; and that whatever “merit” there is, is first God’s gift and only secondarily man’s response. Even the disputed loci—indulgences, purgatory—are, in their doctrinal core, not mechanisms for purchasing salvation but claims about the Church’s intercession and the final purification of those already saved, however much their historical administration has sometimes obscured that intent.
  </p>

  <p>
    The remaining disagreements, then, are best located not in a crude “Incarnation versus Cross” contrast, nor in the suggestion that one tradition has mystery while the other has legalism, but in questions of emphasis and governance: which conceptual grammar ought to lead; how far dogmatic definition should proceed; how later Latin terms (justification, satisfaction, merit, purgatory, indulgences) are to be interpreted and hedged; and—beyond the scope of this note—how questions of ecclesial authority and conciliarity are to be adjudicated. If the aim is genuine understanding rather than polemical victory, it seems wiser to grant what is shared (theosis, grace, real transformation) and to dispute, with patience and precision, where the traditions diverge in articulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    One might even say that Strickland’s argument, when purified of its sharper contrasts, can serve as a salutary reminder to Catholics: to speak of justification and satisfaction only in a way that is transparently ordered to participation, sanctification, and union with God; to ensure that juridical metaphors remain servants rather than masters; and to present the Cross not as an isolated transaction but as the climactic moment of the one economy in which the Incarnate Son heals human nature by assuming it, offering it, and raising it into divine life. If that is the horizon, then the conversation with Orthodoxy becomes less a contest between rival soteriologies and more a sustained effort to confess, in complementary idioms, the one salvation given in Christ.
  </p>
