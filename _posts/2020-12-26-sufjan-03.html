	<div class="epigraph">Elle marchait, s’arrêtait, repartait plus vite, comme quelqu’un qui, dans sa tête, recherche ou repasse des souvenirs, les confronte, les compare, calcule, et soudain pense avoir trouvé ; puis de nouveau lâche le fil et recommence à chercher…</div>

<p>I don’t understand: piety. My vanity is what led me to you, Cassandra (birthed though thou wert by Fraenkl’s schizophrenia); and in my gilded nightmares,
<p>Thinking of St Louis, it is this vanity that has kept me from becoming you. Before you became ill you taught me these words: ‘Only fools suffer’ and ‘I did like the rug he showed us a fortnight ago’ and ‘my memory humbles me’ &c.—
<p>But what illness was yours but a fatigue for life: and because they would not let you for a moment forget that you were not born here, and your lot was to be a divorcée, I imagine there to be some wisdom in these your solitary ramblings.
<p>The only music here came from the piano in the hall: no banjos, decidedly no percussion. My son will learn the violin until age ten and talk about Verdun and Ypres and les cents martyrs géorgiens to his Viennese governess.
<p>He could be a poet, too, if he wanted; we are in need of a poet in the family after all. ‘I think—’ ‘Yes it is never too late for the business of thinking. After all in the summer, when the family goes to the Algarve—’

<p>Saying ‘mixtape’ instead of ‘playlist’ is an affectation, a temporal one: saying ‘flat’ instead of ‘apartment’ is another, albeit here geographical.
<p>One can never imagine the many little things that elude the unconcerned; but one notices things when one pays attention.

<p>We are not separated by oceans: I live a mile from where you are, two miles from where I was born.
<p>My mother has never taught me to pray so when my grandmother died, whom I have only seen thrice in my life I was left to mumble while I looked at the mahogany that housed her, amazed at the pageantry even of death.
<p>She never liked you, but you know that; she never liked anyone, if that’s any consolation. She was cruel was what I understood from my mother’s stories: crueler than she ever needed to be to her children, and crueler still to those who did not share her blood.
