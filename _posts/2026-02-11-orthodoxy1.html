        <h2>2. The “forensic versus participatory” opposition is too simple</h2>
    <p>
        Strickland’s instinct at this point is not without real force, for anyone who has attended to popular forms of Western preaching, or who has lingered over certain late-medieval devotional materials, will readily perceive how easily the idiom of “debt,” “payment,” and “punishment” may degenerate into a quasi-commercial imagination of redemption; and once such a construal becomes habitual, the faith–works dispute can indeed assume an air of near-necessity, since, if salvation be primarily conceived as a verdict, one is at once constrained to ask what conditions are annexed to that verdict, how any remaining penalties are to be discharged, and by what means remission is to be obtained; so that Strickland’s critique is best understood, not as an objection to biblical language as such, but as an objection to reduction, namely, to the tendency whereby one metaphor, originally serviceable within its proper limits, is permitted to harden into a single controlling model. Yet the remedy cannot be to oppose “juridical” to “participatory” as though the former were intrinsically Western, late, or legalistic, and the latter uniquely Eastern, patristic, or spiritual, for the Christian sources themselves are already irreducibly pluriform, speaking at once in forensic terms (justification and condemnation, acquittal and judgment), in cultic terms (sacrifice, offering, priesthood), in familial terms (adoption and inheritance), in medicinal terms (healing and illumination), and in participatory terms (union with Christ, life in the Spirit, incorporation into the Body); nor is this plurality an embarrassment to be disciplined away by a tidying system, but rather a constitutive feature of the scriptural witness, since the economy of salvation is too vast to be exhausted by any single image.

        </p>
    <p>
        The Apostle Paul, in particular, speaks without embarrassment in
        juridical accents, contrasting condemnation and justification, speaking
        of God as judge, and deploying the language of law and verdict; and yet
        the very same Pauline corpus is everywhere saturated with participatory
        and transformative claims, such that the Christian is “in Christ,”
        Christ lives in the believer, the old man dies and a new creation
        arises, believers are incorporated into one body and animated by one
        Spirit, and they are conformed to Christ, not merely pronounced his;
        whence it follows that the juridical and the participatory are not rival
        soteriologies in St. Paul, but concurrent registers within one and the
        same proclamation, as the Fathers themselves, when expounding the
        Pauline theses, commonly refuse to sever what the Apostle joins (e.g.,
        St. John Chrysostom, <em>Homilies on Romans,</em> X).
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Precisely here a Catholic clarification is most needed, for the Catholic
        tradition does not deny, still less disdain, the participatory horizon
        which Strickland associates with theosis, but confesses divinisation and
        speaks of sanctifying grace as a true participation in the divine life
        (CCC 460; 1996–2000; <em>Lumen gentium</em> 2, 40), a confession already
        articulated in patristic form by St. Athanasius (<em>De Incarnatione
        Verbi</em>, 54.3) and echoed, in a cognate register, by St. Irenaeus of
        Lyons (<em>Adversus Haereses</em> V, Pref.); yet neither can it simply
        renounce forensic language, because such language is not a medieval
        invention but apostolic, so that the question is not whether juridical
        terminology may be employed, but whether it is permitted to become a
        self-sufficient and flattening scheme, whether verdict is made to
        exclude communion, or acquittal is made to replace new life. Put
        differently, the deepest problem is not juridical categories as such,
        but legalism; and legalism is not identical with the mere use of
        judicial metaphors, since a court may declare what is already the case,
        whereas God’s judgment, in the Christian proclamation, is not merely
        descriptive but efficacious, such that, when God justifies, he does not
        merely label but effects what he declares, because justification is not
        only remission of sins but also sanctification and renewal of the
        interior man (CCC 1989–1990, 1992; Council of Trent, Sess. VI,
        <em>Decree on Justification</em>, ch. 7), a point which St. Augustine
        states with characteristic directness when, distinguishing the
        righteousness whereby God is righteous from that righteousness which God
        bestows, he speaks of the righteousness “with which he endows man when
        he justifies the ungodly” (<em>De Spiritu et Littera</em>, ch. 15 [IX]);
        and thus the true target is any “transactional” construal that abstracts
        verdict from vitality, liability from communion, or satisfaction from
        sanctification, while simultaneously forgetting that the Church
        condemns, as legalism in the strict sense, any claim that man can be
        justified before God by his own works without divine grace through Jesus
        Christ (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this is granted, the terrain shifts, for Strickland is right to
        warn against construing salvation as a ledger of debts and payments, yet
        it does not follow that forensic language is alien to the apostolic
        mind, nor that the West is doomed to legalism merely by speaking of
        justification and judgment; rather, the question becomes what the proper
        ordering of the biblical metaphors is, and what safeguards prevent any
        one of them from tyrannising the whole, since it is precisely that
        question—concerning the controlling grammar and the requisite
        guardrails—that will permit a clearer assessment of theosis and
        Incarnation on the one hand, and of faith, works, satisfaction, and
        purgatory on the other.

    <h2>3. Theosis and the Incarnation</h2>

    <p>
        Although it has already been conceded that the opposition, as commonly
        framed, between the “forensic” and the “participatory” registers is too
        summary to sustain, without qualification, the whole burden of a
        theological diagnosis, it nevertheless remains necessary to underscore
        what is most sound and most fruitful in Strickland’s point of departure,
        namely, that theosis—participation in the divine life—is not a
        speculative embellishment appended at the margin of Eastern devotion,
        but rather a native and habitual manner in which many of the Eastern
        Fathers articulate salvation, precisely insofar as it draws immediately
        upon the apostolic promise that the faithful are made “partakers of the
        divine nature” (2 Pet 1:4), and thus cannot be reduced to a mere
        alteration of juridical status, as though God had only reclassified the
        sinner by an external decree, but must be understood as the bestowal of
        a new life, that is to say, communion with God, transformation by grace,
        and incorporation into Christ (CCC 1989–1990; CCC 1991; Council of
        Trent, Sess. VI, <em>Decree on Justification</em>, ch. 7).
    </p>
    <p>
        From a Catholic standpoint this emphasis is not alien, since Catholic
        teaching not only permits but positively requires that salvation be
        expounded in participatory terms, the Catechism of the Catholic Church
        speaking without ambiguity of the Incarnation’s purpose in divinising
        language—“The Word became flesh to make us ‘partakers of the divine
        nature’” (CCC 460; cf. CCC 457–460)—and even adopting, with due
        qualification, the patristic idiom that God became man “so that we might
        become God,” namely by grace and participation and not by nature,
        autonomy, or any imagined transmutation of the creature into the Creator
        (CCC 460; CCC 1996–1997), in a manner consonant with the classic Fathers
        whose expressions the Catechism here receives, such as St. Athanasius
        (<em>De Inc.</em>) and St. Irenaeus (<em>Adv. haer.</em> 3.19.1), so
        that theosis is not to be treated as an “Orthodox distinctive” set over
        against Catholic soteriology, but as part of the common patristic
        inheritance, expressed with different accents and under different
        preferred vocabularies (CCC 460).

    </p>
    <p>
        By this fact there is corrected, at the outset, a misimpression to which Strickland’s presentation might inadvertently give occasion, for if the question be whether Catholicism knows an account of salvation as participation, the answer is plainly affirmative (CCC 460; CCC 1989–1991), whereas if the question be rather why Eastern theology tends more habitually to lead with communion and transfiguration, while Western theology has often, especially in polemical seasons, given prominent place to juridical and sacrificial idioms, then what is at issue is less a contradiction of doctrine than a difference of rhetorical and theological prioritisation within the one faith, a diversity which may be legitimate so long as it remains ordered to the integrity of the apostolic deposit and does not collapse into reduction (Unitatis Redintegratio 4).

    </p>
    <p>
        Accordingly, the contrast sometimes drawn between “Incarnation” and “Cross” is best received, not as a doctrinal diagnosis, but as a caution against imbalance, since Catholic doctrine is clear that the Incarnation is not a preliminary scene set before “the real work” of redemption begins, even while it teaches with equal clarity that redemption “comes to us above all through the blood of his cross,” holding together both affirmations when it states that “the mystery of Christ’s Redemption is at work in a hidden way throughout his entire life” and yet “comes to us above all through the blood of his cross” (CCC 517; cf. CCC 512–515; CCC 571–618), so that the point is not to attenuate the Cross, but to refuse to sever it from that one economy in which God unites humanity to himself and heals it from within, a logic which the Fathers express, in their own manner, when St. Gregory of Nazianzus insists that what is not assumed is not healed (Ep. 101.5), and when St. Leo the Great speaks of the believer’s elevation by grace to participation in divine life through the mystery of the Word made flesh (Sermo 21.2).
    </p>
    <p>
        If this be granted, then what is strongest in Strickland’s argument may be retained without conceding what is overstated, for he is right to desire that salvation be understood as transformative union rather than as mere acquittal, and Catholics can agree, and indeed must insist, that salvation involves real incorporation into Christ and real sanctification by grace (CCC 1265–1266; CCC 1989–1991), the necessary clarification being only that the Church is not obliged to choose between registers which Scripture itself employs, since the juridical and sacrificial language is ordered to serve, and not to supplant, the participatory end for which humanity is created—communion with God—an end which justification itself, rightly understood, both presupposes and effects insofar as it is not only remission but also sanctification and interior renewal (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, Decretum de iustificatione, cap. 7; CCC 1990–1991; CCC 1999).

    </p>

  <section>

  <h2>4. Faith, works, “transaction,” and purgatory</h2>

    <p>
        With these preliminaries in place, the perennial faith–works question
        may be treated with greater exactitude and with less polemical heat, for
        Rev. Strickland is correct that the popular contrast—“Protestants say
        faith alone, Catholics say faith plus works”—often operates as a
        serviceable caricature only by construing “works” as independent inputs
        by which one purchases justification, whereas the Council of Trent
        expressly condemns the claim that a man may be justified “by his own
        works … without the grace of God through Jesus Christ” (Council of
        Trent, Sess. VI, can. 1), and the Catechism of the
        Catholic Church likewise describes justification as the gratuitous gift
        of God’s sanctifying grace, which precedes, enables, and sustains any
        salutary human movement (CCC 1996–2001; cf. CCC 2001).
    </p>

    <p>
        The more precise Catholic claim, therefore, is not that works compete
        with grace as a co-cause, but that faith is not meant to remain a bare
        and inert assent, since it is ordered to become living faith, that is,
        faith “working through love” (Gal 5:6), and the works that follow are
        not a rival principle set alongside grace but rather the fruit,
        manifestation, and cooperative expression of grace’s efficacy in the
        renewed person (CCC 1814–1816; CCC 2008–2011); hence the dispute becomes
        notably less confused once one distinguishes (i) the efficient cause of
        justification, which is the gratuitous mercy of God in Christ (CCC
        1996–2000; Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. 1–3), (ii) the nature of
        faith as a living adherence that tends intrinsically toward charity (Gal
        5:6; Council of Trent, Sess. VI, ch. 7–8), and (iii) the place of works,
        not as purchase-money, but as participatory obedience and consequent
        cooperation—real, yet derivative—within a life already quickened by
        grace (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. 4; CCC 2001–2002).
    </p>

    <p>
        At this juncture the term “merit” commonly becomes the stumbling-block,
        and it must be said with equal firmness that Catholic doctrine does
        employ the language of merit and reward while simultaneously excluding
        any Pelagian imagination of autonomous earning, precisely because it
        intends to safeguard two truths at once, namely, that God remains the
        sovereign author of salvation and that the human person is not saved as
        a stone is moved but as a living agent whose will is truly healed,
        elevated, and enabled to cooperate (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. 4;
        CCC 2001–2002); accordingly, when the Church speaks of “merit,” she
        means a reality grounded wholly in prior gift, so that even the reward
        promised to good works is itself the free completion of what grace has
        already begun (CCC 2006–2011; Council of Trent, Sess. VI, ch. 16), which
        is why St. Augustine can say, in the very locus most often invoked for
        this point, that when God “crowns our merits, He crowns nothing other
        than His own gifts” (St. Augustine, Epistula 194, 5.19 (to St. Sixtus);
        cf. CSEL 57:190).
    </p>

    <p>
        It is also here that the “transactional” imagery which Strickland
        critiques ought to be treated with some discrimination, since there were
        indeed periods in which Western preaching and penitential practice,
        especially at the popular level and most evidently in connection with
        abuses, were expressed in ledger-like terms of debts, satisfactions,
        remissions, and indulgences spoken of as though they were spiritual
        commodities; yet the Church’s doctrinal guardrails, when stated in their
        proper form, are markedly non-commercial, for she defines an indulgence
        as the remission “before God” of temporal punishment due to sins already
        forgiven as to guilt, granted under prescribed conditions through the
        Church’s ministry (CCC 1471), insists that “temporal punishment” is not
        to be conceived as divine vengeance externally inflicted but as a
        consequence of sin’s intrinsic disorder that calls for purification,
        healing, and detachment (CCC 1472–1473), and, in her own authoritative
        reforms, both condemns “evil traffic” in indulgences and mandates
        correction of abuses (Council of Trent, Sess. XXV (4 Dec 1563), Decree
        Concerning Indulgences), while St. Paul VI states with particular
        clarity that indulgences “cannot be acquired without a sincere
        conversion of mentality (‘metanoia’) and unity with God” (St. Paul VI,
        Indulgentiarum doctrina (1 Jan 1967), 11).
  </p>

  <p>
        Purgatory belongs to the same zone of frequent misunderstanding, and
        thus the distinction between medieval imaginative literature or popular
        representations and the doctrinal nucleus is indispensable, for the
        Catholic claim is neither that the saved are “in hell for a while” nor
        that purgatory constitutes a second damnation, but rather that those who
        die in God’s friendship while still imperfectly purified undergo a final
        purification, the purpose of which is precisely the holiness required
        for communion with God (CCC 1030–1032); in this sense the doctrine does
        not compete with theosis but, in a certain respect, protects the premise
        that salvation is real transformation, since if sanctification is not a
        legal fiction but a true healing and re-formation, then the logic of
        purification—whether completed in this life, or, by divine mercy,
        brought to completion beyond—follows as a corollary (CCC 1030–1031; cf.
        1 Cor 3:15), and the Church, while warning against speculative
        curiosities, has given this claim determinate magisterial articulation,
        as in the Council of Florence (Council of Florence, Bull of Union with
        the Greeks Laetentur caeli (6 Jul 1439), DH 1304) and again in the sober
        disciplinary decree of Trent, which affirms purgatory and directs
        pastors to exclude what is “difficult and subtle” or unedifying from
        popular instruction (Council of Trent, Sess. XXV, Decree Concerning
        Purgatory). 
    </p>

    <p>
        It should further be observed that the instinct operative here is not
        wholly foreign to the Christian East, for the practice of praying for
        the departed and entrusting them to God’s mercy presupposes that what
        remains incomplete in us may yet be healed by God, and the Catholic
        Church herself appeals to this ancient practice when she speaks of
        “prayers in suffrage for them” (CCC 1032; cf. 2 Macc 12:46), a practice
        witnessed with particular explicitness by St. Cyril of Jerusalem, who
        teaches, within the eucharistic context, that the commemoration of the
        departed brings “a very great benefit to the souls” for whom
        supplication is offered (St. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lectures,
        23.9–10), and likewise by St. John Chrysostom, who, while exhorting
        prayer and almsgiving on behalf of the dead, remarks that “not in vain
        did the Apostles order that remembrance should be made of the dead in
        the dreadful Mysteries” (St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on Philippians,
        Homily 3, 65–66); therefore the disagreement, when stated with due care,
        is not simply “purification versus no purification,” but rather concerns
        how far one can or ought to define the manner of that purification, and
        how one prevents legitimate definition from degenerating into imagery of
        terror, payment, or commercial exchange.
  </p>

    <section>

  <h2>5. An aside on “mystery” and the Latin Church</h2>

  <p>
        One further consideration, commonly remaining tacit beneath these
        comparisons yet requiring, if the comparison is to be conducted with
        intellectual fairness, to be articulated with some explicitness, is that
        when Strickland opposes an Orthodox ease before mystery to certain
        Western habits of juridical distinction, he does, at least at the level
        of theological idiom and customary rhetorical register, lay hold of
        something not wholly unreal, inasmuch as many of the East’s more
        characteristic voices exhibit an apophatic reticence and a preference
        for liturgical and doxological utterance, whereas the Latin inheritance
        has often shown a marked inclination toward analytic precision and
        conceptual differentiation; yet it would be a palpable non sequitur,
        drawn merely from this divergence of verbal temper, to infer either that
        the West is therefore “mystery-averse,” or that the very act of
        distinguishing, as such, is already tantamount to rationalism, as though
        intellectual clarity were, by its nature, inimical to contemplation (cf.
        <em>Fides et Ratio</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
        For the Western tradition also is penetrated by an apophatic sensibility
        precisely insofar as, while confessing God truly, it insists no less
        firmly upon divine incomprehensibility, upon the strict limits of
        creaturely language, and upon the necessity of analogical predication:
        God “transcends all creatures,” so that speech concerning him must
        undergo continual purification, and even where such speech does, by
        grace, attain to God, it does so without circumscribing him (CCC 42–43),
        indeed under that rule which Catechism of the Catholic Church itself, by
        appeal to Fourth Lateran Council, renders in lapidary form, namely, that
        “between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without
        implying an even greater dissimilitude” (CCC 43; Lateran IV, DS 806).
        Its scholastic method—when exercised according to its proper intention
        and not in a spirit of arid disputation—was not ordered to the
        dissipation of mystery into explanation, but to the removal of
        confusions which impede contemplation; and thus, in that same spirit,
        the Church’s development of technical terminology is not a capitulation
        of faith to “human wisdom,” but an instrument by which an ineffable
        mystery may be signified as mystery, “infinitely beyond all that we can
        humanly understand” (CCC 251). Accordingly, when the most careful
        scholastics distinguish, they do so—at least in principle—not in order
        to domesticate the divine, but in order to prevent crude literalism and
        thereby to safeguard what cannot be comprehended, since, as St. Thomas
        Aquinas writes in the Summa theologiae, “His essence is above all that
        we understand about God, and signify in word” (ST I, q. 13, a. 1, ad 1).
        Nor is this restraint absent from the broader Western inheritance, since
        the confession of God as “immense” and “incomprehensible” belongs to the
        Church’s dogmatic lexicon as such in First Vatican Council’s Dei Filius;
        and the same reverent inhibition is voiced with memorable directness by
        St. Augustine, who, in Sermo 117, warns: “If you comprehend, it is not
        God.”    </p>

    <p>
        Accordingly, the point may most charitably be stated as a difference of
        habitual temperaments of expression, rather than as a difference between
        “mystery” and “clarity” as such, for the danger attendant upon the
        Western temperament is reduction—when metaphor is treated as mechanism,
        or when juridical language, taken out of its proper theological
        subordination, is permitted to eclipse communion—whereas the danger
        attendant upon the Eastern temperament, when caricatured or misapplied,
        can be a suspicion of precision as such, as though clarity were always a
        betrayal of mystery; yet mystery and clarity are not enemies, because
        Christian doctrine does not presume to comprehend God exhaustively, but
        seeks to confess truly what God has revealed, and it does so in such a
        manner that worship is guarded from distortion and the Gospel proclaimed
        without confusion, a task which—precisely because it is ministerial
        rather than domineering—belongs to the Church’s living teaching office,
        which, as Second Vatican Council teaches in Dei Verbum, is “not above
        the word of God, but serv[ing] it” (DV 10; cf. CCC 86). In this same
        register, the Church’s sacramental life—Latin no less than
        Byzantine—remains a continual pedagogy of the visible bearing the
        invisible, since the sacraments are “efficacious signs of grace” whose
        visible rites “signify and make present” what they confer (CCC 1131).

  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Strickland’s proem—Incarnation, then theosis—is plainly intended to displace, as the controlling grammar of redemption, a narrowed courtroom model in which verdict, payment, and satisfaction are permitted to function as the principal explanatory keys, and to restore, as the governing horizon, that communion-and-transformation model in which participation and healing are determinative; upon that fundamental point a Catholic may readily concur, since the Word did truly become flesh in order that man might become “a partaker of the divine nature” (2 Pet 1:4; CCC 460; St. Athanasius, <i>De Incarnatione</i> 54.3), and since grace is not to be conceived as a bare remission external to the subject, but as an efficacious gift whereby man is inwardly renewed and made capable of a new life in Christ (CCC 1987–1995; CCC 1996–2005; 2 Cor 5:17; Rom 6:4). If, moreover, certain strands of Western preaching or devotional habit have, at times, given the impression that salvation is chiefly a matter of spiritual accounting, and that the drama of redemption is to be narrated as though it were principally a transaction, the critique is not without a real object, and Catholics need not deny those historical pathologies by which such caricatures have sometimes been rendered plausible.
  </p>

    Where clarification is required is in the implied opposition between a “participatory East” and a “juridical West,” as though the latter were intrinsically legalistic, or as though its juridical idiom were essentially post-schism; for the Christian sources themselves speak in multiple registers, and Holy Scripture—St. Paul above all—employs judicial metaphors without embarrassment, while simultaneously proclaiming a salvation that is, in its substance, participatory and transformative, consisting in incorporation into Christ, life in the Spirit, and conformity to the Son (Rom 3:21–26; Rom 5:1; Gal 2:16; Rom 8:1–17; 1 Cor 12:12–13). The issue, therefore, is not whether forensic language may be used, but whether any one register is permitted to tyrannise the whole—whether verdict is abstracted from communion, whether satisfaction is detached from sanctification, and whether “punishment” language is severed from its proper end in purification and healing (CCC 1691–1698; CCC 1990–1991).

    Read with those guardrails in view, much of Strickland’s critique can be received as a warning against reduction rather than as a verdict against Catholic doctrine itself; for Catholic teaching, taken on its own terms, is not “faith plus works” in the sense of a competitive addition, nor is it a denial of theosis, but rather a confession that justification is sheer gift, effected by grace through Christ (CCC 1987–1995; Eph 2:8–10; Council of Trent, Sess. VI [1547], <i>Decree on Justification</i>, cap. 8), that faith, if genuine, becomes living faith through charity (Gal 5:6; CCC 1814–1816; CCC 1822–1829), that works are the fruit and the graced cooperation of the renewed person rather than an independent currency (CCC 2008–2011), and that whatever “merit” there is is first God’s gift and only secondarily man’s response (CCC 2006–2011; Council of Trent, Sess. VI [1547], <i>Decree on Justification</i>, cap. 16). Even the disputed loci—indulgences, purgatory—are, in their doctrinal core, not mechanisms for purchasing salvation but claims concerning the Church’s intercession and the final purification of those already saved, however much their historical administration has sometimes obscured that intent (CCC 1030–1032; CCC 1471–1479; Council of Trent, Sess. XXV [1563], <i>Decree concerning Purgatory</i>; Council of Trent, Sess. XXV [1563], <i>Decree concerning Indulgences</i>; Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification [1999], §§15–17).

    The remaining disagreements, then, are best located not in a crude “Incarnation versus Cross” contrast, nor in the suggestion that one tradition has mystery while the other has legalism, but in questions of emphasis and governance: which conceptual grammar ought to lead; how far dogmatic definition should proceed; how later Latin terms (justification, satisfaction, merit, purgatory, indulgences) are to be interpreted and hedged; and—beyond the scope of this note—how questions of ecclesial authority and conciliarity are to be adjudicated. If the aim is genuine understanding rather than polemical victory, it seems wiser to grant what is shared (participation in divine life, grace, real transformation: 2 Pet 1:4; CCC 460; CCC 1987–1995) and thereafter to dispute, with patience and precision, where the traditions diverge in articulation.

    One might even say that Strickland’s argument, when purified of its sharper contrasts, can serve as a salutary reminder to Catholics: to speak of justification and satisfaction only in a manner transparently ordered to participation, sanctification, and union with God (CCC 1987–1995; CCC 1996–2005); to ensure that juridical metaphors remain servants rather than masters; and to present the Cross not as an isolated transaction but as the climactic moment of the one economy in which the Incarnate Son heals human nature by assuming it, offering it, and raising it into divine life (CCC 515–518; CCC 599–618; St. Gregory of Nazianzus, <i>Ep.</i> 101.32). If that is the horizon, then the conversation with Orthodoxy becomes less a contest between rival soteriologies and more a sustained effort to confess, in complementary idioms, the one salvation given in Christ.
