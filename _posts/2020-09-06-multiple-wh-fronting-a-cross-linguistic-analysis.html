title: Multiple wh-fronting&#58; a comparative study
---

Multiple <em>wh</em>-fronting involves the movement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>wh</em>-words</a> to the start of the sentence. Following <a href="#rudin1988">Rudin&rsquo;s (1988)</a> typology on her seminal paper on the topic, we can classify languages into three groups with regards to how their syntax operates on both simple and complex content questions. In the first group are languages like Chinese where <em>wh</em>-words always remain <em>in situ</em>, i.e., they inherit the position of the noun phrase they replace in the sentence, as we see in example (1a) below. In the second group are languages like English, where simple questions (i.e., questions with only one <em>wh</em>-item) while more complex ones only allow one <em>wh</em>-item to be fronted with the remaining <em>wh</em>-items remaining <em>in situ</em> (see example 1b). Finally we have a third group, which include among others Bulgarian or Romanian, that requires all <em>wh</em>-items to be moved clause-initially whenever possible. (In fact there is a fourth group, intermediate between the first and the second, and including languages like French, as we see in example 1c below, but we will be ignoring this further distinction as it is not relevant for the purposes of this article.)
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>(adapted from Rudin 1988: 1-2)
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Chinese:<br>Ni xiang-zhidao Lisi <u>weisheme</u> mai-le <u>sheme</u>?<br>
					you wonder Lisi <u>why</u> bought <u>what</u><br>
					&lsquo;<u>What</u> do you wonder <u>why</u> Lisi bought (it)?&rsquo;
				</li>
				<li>English:<br><u>What</u> did you give <u>to whom</u>?</li>
				<li>French:<br>
					<u>Qu</u>&rsquo;as-tu donn&eacute; <u>&agrave; qui&#8239;</u>? = Tu as donn&eacute; <u>quoi</u> <u>&agrave; qui&#8239;</u>?<br>
					&lsquo;What have you given to whom&rsquo;
				</li>
				<li>Russian:<br>
					<u>Кто</u> <u>что</u> <u>когда</u> сказал?<br>
					who what when said<br>
					&lsquo;Who said what when?&rsquo;
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>

Iridian belongs to this fourth group, as do all Slavic languages and Romanian. Whether this characteristic is a consequence of Iridian syntax or brought about by the language&rsquo;s contact with the Slavic languages is unclear. It is most likely the first case though, since as we see in the case of Hungarian and Romanian, both non-Slavic languages forming part of the larger Central and Eastern European linguistic area (which for simplicity we will call the Slavo-Germanic <em>Sprachbund</em>), although multiple <em>wh-</em> fronting (MWF) is characteristically Slavic, its diffusion to the other languages in the region is not complete:

<blockquote>
	<ol start="2">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Hungarian (Kiss 2003: 100):<br>
					<u>Kit</u> vesz el <u>ki</u> a reg&eacute;ny  v&eacute;g&eacute;n?<br>
					whom marries VM who the novel’s end-at<br>
					‘Whom does who marry at the end of the novel?’
				</li>

				<li>Romanian (Rudin 1988: 449):<br>
					<u>Cine</u> <u>cu ce</u> merge?<br>
					who with what goes<br>
					&lsquo;Who goes by what?&rsquo; (i.e., means of transportation)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The simple case of <em>wh</em>-fronting can be seen as an extension of Iridian&rsquo;s preference for copular constructions in explanatory or clarificatory sentences. That the simple WF in Iridian is essentially a copular construction is made more overt in colloquial speech by the tendency to nominalise the whole phrase altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol start="3">
		<li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Jede to mila šviržek?<br>
					Who wrote this song?
				</li>

				<li>With a nomialised verb phrase (colloquial):<br>
					Jede to mila šviržkou?<br>
					Who wrote this song? (lit., Who is the person who wrote this song?)
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
