<i>L’enfer, c’est les autres.</i> Or so I thought. The previous months, however, locked up in a box while the world around me breathed its last breath, has shown me that the hell I feared was within me all along. I had inklings of it before, of course, but the many distractions the world offered then was enough to take my mind off it. Now, with no choice but to face my own thoughts in all their rawness and ugliness, I have belatedly learned to accept the fact.</p>
