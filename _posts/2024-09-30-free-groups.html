        I'm in the second year of my masters (whew!) and I'm currently taking a seminar course where my professor asked me to present at the end of the term a paper on universal quadratic forms (after a paper I had written a year ago for my number theory class). At the same time, I am trying to brush up on my algebra and thus decided to start learning some Galois theory (the algebra curriculum for the master's degree at La Salle did not include this) as I am planning to build on my paper and maybe write my thesis on some algebraic number theory topic. (Although to be honest I am still quite clueless at this point.) Besides, my qualifying exams are coming up (I am planning to take them in the next term if all goes well) and was about to start reviewing for it anyway.
    </p>

        In any case, I've been studying from Aluffi's <i>Algebra: Chapter 0</i> and have been enjoying it so far. In particular, even though I've already taken a course in algebraic rewriting earlier in the year, the notion of free groups only seemed to click now. (Although again we only ever talked about rewriting systems in that course without particular emphasis on the universal property of free groups and their construction.) This post is basically a rehash of what I've learned so far which I write here because of a newfound appreciation for the subject. (I wanted to write about the canonical decomposition of a group homomorphism &mdash; another topic I've recently gained an appreciation for &mdash; but I think I'll save that for another post.)

        The group $F(X)$ is a <em>free group</em> on the set $X$ (or alternatively, we say that $F(X)$ is <em>free</em> on $X$) if there is a set function $\iota: X \to F(X)$ such that for any group $G$ and any set function $\phi: X \to G$, there exists a unique group homomorphism $\Phi: F(X) \to G$ such that $\Phi \circ \iota = \phi$, i.e., the following diagram commutes:

        This means that every function from a set $X$ to a group $G$ can be decomposed into a function from $X$ to $F(X)$ followed by a homomorphism from $F(X)$ to $G$. Writing $F(X)$ is purely a notational convenience, to remind us that the group is free on $X$.
        </p>
        <p>
        If such a group exists, it is unique up to isomorphism. Consider for example a set $X$ and a set $G$ and suppose that $F_1$ and $F_2$ are groups satisfying the universal property in our definition. Then because $F_1$ is free on $X$ and $F_2$ is a group (and vice versa), we have:

        <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1-1vwoT2f3nvmsLhQnqMj8BwFG1zt7QRX&sz=w1000" width="25%">
        <p>
        where $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are group homomorphisms whose existence is guaranteed by the universal property for $F_1$ and $F_2$, respectively. We then have
        $$\Phi \circ \iota_1 = \iota_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \Psi \circ \iota_2 = \iota_1.$$
        Substituting $\iota_1$ in the first equation with $\Psi \circ \iota_2$ (and vice versa) gives us
        $$
        \Phi \circ \Psi \circ \iota_2 = \iota_2 \quad \text{i.e.,} \quad \Phi \circ \Psi = \operatorname{id}_{F_2}
        $$
        and
        $$
        \Psi \circ \Phi \circ \iota_1 = \iota_1 \quad \text{i.e.,} \quad \Psi \circ \Phi = \operatorname{id}_{F_1}.
        $$
        <p>
        That is $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are inverses of each other, so $F_1$ and $F_2$ are isomorphic.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative characterization would be to consider for a set $X$ the category $\mathcal{F}^X$ whose objects are pairs $(k, G)$ where each $k$ is a set function $X \to G$ and each $G$ is a group, and whose morphisms are commutative diagrams of set functions of the form

            where again each $k_i$ is a set function $X \to G_i$ and each $G_i$ is a group, and where $\phi$ is a group homomorphism. Since we are considering all set functions $X \to G$, we are not encoding any group structure in the objects of $\mathcal{F}^X$. The free group $F(X)$ is then the group component of an initial object (which we write $(k_0, F(X))$) in $\mathcal{F}^X$.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Because $(k_0, F(X))$ is initial in $\mathcal{F}^X$, there is a unique morphism from $(k_0, F(X))$ to any other object $(k, G)$ in $\mathcal{F}^X$. This morphism is a group homomorphism $\Phi: F(X) \to G$ such that $\Phi \circ k_0 = k$. This is the same as saying that $F(X)$ is free on $X$ (based on our earlier definition). Moreover, because $(k_0, F(X))$ is initial, it is unique up to isomorphism.

        An initial object in a category need not necessarily exist. We shall now show, however, that there exists an initial object in the category $\mathcal{F}^X$.

        Consider a set $X$ and let $X^*$ be an isomorphic copy of $X$ with $X \cap X^* = \emptyset$. Since $X \cong X^*$, we can choose a bijection $\phi : X \to X^*$ and write $x^*$ for $\phi(x)$ for all $x \in X$. (If $x^* \in X^*$ then the preimage of $x^*$ is $x$, and thus $x^{**} = x$ by definition.) We define a <em>word</em> in $X$ to be a finite $n$-tuple of elements of $x_i \in X \cup X^*$ of the form
        $$
        (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)
        $$
        which we will denote by juxtaposition
        $$
        w = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n.
        $$
        We shall call $X \cup X^*$ the <em>alphabet</em> on $X$ and each $a_i$ a <em>letter</em> on this alphabet. The number $n$ is the <em>length</em> of the word $w$. For example, if $X = \{a, b\}$, then
        $$
        abba^*b^*a^*
        $$
        is a word of length $6$ on the alphabet $\{a, b, a^*, b^*\}$. For each $a$ we call $a^*$ the <em>inverse</em> of $a$, noting however that our usage here does not necessarily coincide with the group-theoretic notion of an inverse. (For this reason we have used the symbol $a^*$ instead of $a^{-1}$ to emphasize this point.) Write $W(X)$ for the set of all words in $X$, with the empty word (written $\epsilon$) defined as the set containing no letters.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The concatenation of two words $w_1 = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_m$ and $w_2 = y_1 y_2 \cdots y_n$ is the word
        $$
        w_1 w_2 = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_m y_1 y_2 \cdots y_n.
        $$
        A <em>substring</em> of a word $w = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n$ is a word of the form $x_i x_{i + 1} \cdots x_j$ for some $i, j$ with $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$. We can immediately observe that the empty word is a substring of any word. We shall call a word $w = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n$ <em>reduced</em> if it contains no substrings of the form $aa^*$ or $a^*a$. For example, the word $abb^*a$ is not reduced, but the word $ab$ is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we want to introduce a process through which, say, two words $bab^*bb$ and $babb^*baa^*$ in $X = \{a, b\}$ both simplify to the same word $bab$, i.e., we want the <em>inverse</em> $a^*$ of $a$ to behave in a similar manner as a group inverse (in the limited sense that inverses <em>cancel out</em> each other). To do this, we first define a map $W(X) \to W(X)$ that deletes from a given word $w$ any pair of the form $aa^*$ or $a^*a$. We call the image of $w$ under this map an <em>elementary reduction</em> of $w$. Our goal then is to find for each word $w$ in $X$ a sequence of elementary reductions
            $$
            w = w_0 \mapsto w_1 \mapsto w_2 \mapsto \cdots \mapsto w_n
            $$
            where $w_n$ is a word in $X$ that cannot be further reduced, i.e., any elementary reduction of $w_n$ is equal to $w_n$. (That is, $w_n$ is a reduced word by our earlier definition.) For each word $w$, at least one such sequence of elementary reductions exists, which we obtain by considering only reductions that delete the first occurrence of a pair of the form $aa^*$ or $a^*a$ from left to right. This must terminate after $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ steps, where $n$ is the length of $w$, as each elementary reduction of this type decreases the length of the word by $2$. For the more general case, we refer to the following result, often called the <em>diamond lemma</em>.
