<p class="epigraph">
(after Ezra K.)</p>
<p class="sec-start">
I&rsquo;ve been trying to write a big status rerum of a blog post ever since I stopped keeping a journal two years ago, just after finishing uni. (The last one devolved into a barely coherent theological treatise.) Not that I think anyone would have been interested to know what happened to me during those two (or three) years, the journals I have kept for myself after all&mdash;still it nagged me, the silence, and I kept arriving at the same conclusion whenever I try to justify to myself my failing to write anything: that the years I&rsquo;ve failed to record are gone, in the worst sense of the word. I&rsquo;ve always thought of photos and videos as paltry excuses for preserving memories, preferring the genuineness, the rawness of the written (or maybe, if I were more honest, their malleability, their submitting to my whims instead of those of the often ugly truth). Lately I&rsquo;ve discovered a new excuse: that I was to busy living in the moment, and that it was better that way, so much so that my failure to write was not only excuseable, but preferrable.</p>
<p>
Of course I&rsquo;ve attempted various times to start writing again. There was a line from One Day though that kept popping up on my head whenever I&RSQUO;m buying a new notebook, sniffing (resignedly) the lush creamcolored pages I know I&RSQUO;ll never fill up: that maybe what I thought was a passion for writing was merely a &lsquo;fetish for stationery.&rsquo; I never fully understood why I stopped, although I have a theory: my old writing was filled with angst (but what teenager&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t); but slowly, imperceptibly, the angst was replied by exhaustion, resignation. &lsquo;I have become one of them,&rsquo; I found myself writing again and again throughout these three (or two) years, but I no longer idea what &lsquo;them&rsquo; even means now, or whether my idea of the other even made sense back when I thought I understood what it meant.</p>
