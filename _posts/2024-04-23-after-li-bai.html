<div class="hangind">
    <p>The stream runs quietly through the valley, my face red</p>
    <p>From the wine hides behind the shadow of a mulberry tree.</p>
    <p>The afternoon sun is gentle, unlike a child's laughter,</p>
    <p>Always mocking, always cruel, and the wind softly blows.</p>
    <p>Calm, calmer still, the rustling of the leaves anoint me.</p>
    <p>In this strange land I have found at last a home. Do the</p>
    <p>Birds here speak the same language as the ones I have known</p>
    <p>When a child; or, transported, would they have been as lost</p>
    <p>Here as I once was? The heat carries the scent of mud. There</p>
    <p>Is the littlest bead of sweat on my chest and brow. A single</p>
    <p>Sparrow cackles: overhead in a branch it spasms. Would it</p>
    <p>Dare violate the sanctity of this hour?</p>
