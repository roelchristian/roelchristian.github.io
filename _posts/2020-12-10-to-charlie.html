      <p>Should I call you brother, child or friend? I knew of you only when
      <p>you died. Before that you were just a name, my life a catalogue of
      <p>names like yours, & sometimes when I’m lucky, of faces (how I wish
      <p>know I remembered yours) —But then you died & the universe
      <p>started talking in your voice & at first I thought I was getting mad
      <p>but how could I get madder than I already was. —& the voices kept
      <p>me nights thinking of the life wasted in not knowing you & the
      <p>voices did not die down & I learned silence is but an illusion & so is
      <p>everything. Said Milton: the mind is its own place (I only believe in
      <p>priests & blind men & he was both) & slowly I managed to banish
      <p>the voices by playing games with myself where I can never win &
      <p>only lose. —But the universe is talking again, Charlie. This time the
      <p>voice is louder, though the voice is still yours. Help me: I’d like to
      <p>think this was your fault.
