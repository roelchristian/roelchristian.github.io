title: Converbial constructions in Iridian
---

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Converbs are non-finite verb forms that are mainly used in adverbial subordination. In addition to the converb, Iridian also distinguishes between three other non-finite verb forms: the gerund, the supine, and generic nominal formed by the suffix <i>-ou</i>. Typically, the converb modifies another verb, called the main verb, together forming a complex predicate describing a single action or event. The converb always precedes the main verb.</p>

<p>There are two converb forms in Iridian, with the distinction being based on aspect: the imperfective <i>-ěc</i> and the perfective <i>-u</i>. Both converb forms, however, are not marked for voice/focus, as they are non-finite, and therefore the suffix will directly attach to the verb root.</p>

<h2>Specific converbial constructions</h2>

<h3>Temporal constructions</h3>

Often used in temporal clauses, with the imperfective converbial form used when the action is unfinished or continuing and the perfective otherwise. When used in a temporal clause, the converb may sometimes be separated from the main clause by the particle <i>si</i>.
