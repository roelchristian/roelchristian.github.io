<div class="hangind">
	<p> How she disturbed us,
	<p>Touching her little breasts with her white little
	<p>Hands that smelled of perfumed water, a queasy
	<p>Reverence made almost nostalgic by the heat
	<p>Of afternoons like this before, irrevocable, calamitous,
	<p>Which we tell ourselves was a glory worth the while.
	<p>Shouldn’t we have stopped there and then
	<p>Before we became impalpable whiners,
	<p>Sad men, malcontents,
	<p>Thinking of the future to forget the past
	<p>While we are still young and they forgive us.
	<p>The shrill voice of afternoons like this wake us
	<p>At midnight among the orchids and canaries,
	<p>Sweet, sweet days!
	<p>But soon effaced, they leave us longing for unfulfilled promises
	<p>Like pariah dogs or union workers,
	<p>But aren’t we too old now, our backs too hunched to
	<p>Disturb the world and its young men?
	<p>Even then our inevitable fate would make us
	<p>Profit nothing, lest we too bow our heads
	<p>Not in humility or resignation but in a stubbornness dearer to us
	<p>Than our own lives. And isn’t she
	<p>Beautiful?
