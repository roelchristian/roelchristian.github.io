Yesterday I was listening to an
[episode](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2025/02/12/episode-318-orthodox-questions-with-father-john-strickland-part-1/){:target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"} of Robin Pierson's <em>History of Byzantium</em>
featuring a conversation between the host and Rev. John Strickland, an Orthodox
priest and scholar, on some of the more common questions touching Orthodoxy as
it is practised and understood by its faithful. Although I possess some general
acquaintance with their beliefs and their liturgy — bearing in mind, of course,
that for nearly a millennium the Orthodox and the Catholic shared the same
apostolic faith, and judging moreover, if I may speak with candour, that the
divergences which issued in schism appear, when viewed across the longer tract
of time and from the remove of several centuries, to have depended more upon
politics and the contingencies of history than upon theology; or at the very
least, without downplaying whatever real theological differences arose and
continue to separate the two churches, to have been exacerbated rather by
geographical separation and by the politics of the age — I remain, alas, no more
than this: an outsider, neither myself Orthodox nor a scholar of Orthodoxy.

## 1. Rev. Strickland&rsquo;s thesis

Of that exchange there remains in my memory, two points above all. The first
concerns soteriology, with Strickland contending that the Latin West, by a
gradual habituation, became increasingly disposed toward legalisms and toward
those fine distinctions which arise, almost of necessity, when the question is
prosecuted in a juridical idiom, whereas the Orthodox, as he would have it, are
more content to leave certain questions within the province of mystery; and thus
it comes about, he says, that the polemical disputes of the Reformation, so
commonly cast in the antithesis of “faith alone” and “faith plus works,” remain,
for the Orthodox mind, largely alien, precisely because such disputes presuppose
a forensic register which, on his account, developed in the West after the
schism. The second point concerns purgatory, which the Orthodox categorically reject as a doctrine, although it should be readily demonstrable how this second point can, when properly analyzed, be seen as a downstream implication of the first.[^1a]

[^1a]: To contrast, he further mentions the Orthodox notion of aerial toll-houses—something which I recall having heard before—while taking care to qualify it as not, strictly speaking, a doctrine in its own right, but rather a pious opinion, a θεολογούμενον.

The core of Strickland’s argument, however, is not an excursus upon post-mortem
states, but a proposal concerning the idiom in which salvation is to be
articulated. The familiar antithesis of “faith alone” and “faith plus works,” he
suggests, is not a trans-ecclesial problem so much as a product of a particular
Western polemical field—one whose internal logic tends to translate redemption
into the categories of the courtroom: justification as verdict, salvation as
acquittal, and penance and satisfaction as liabilities and remissions. If
compelled to answer within that frame, he says, Orthodoxy will certainly insist
upon faith in Jesus Christ as central and indispensable; but it will refuse any
clean disjunction between faith and works, since the two are not competing
currencies but inseparable expressions of a single life in Christ.

Accordingly, Strickland renders the Orthodox account of salvation, not in
forensic categories, but in the idiom of _theosis_ (deification)[^theosis]:
because the Word has assumed human nature, humanity may, by grace, participate
in God’s own life. Faith and works, therefore, do not admit of any clean
separation, inasmuch as faith, by its very nature, must issue in works of
love—not as though works were an additional mechanism set alongside faith, but
as the enacted form in which faith subsists.

[^theosis]: And here, following the typical definition of the term, he intends,
    not that deification taught by the Latter-day Saints, by which through
    &lsquo;exaltation&rsquo; men &lsquo;will become gods&rsquo; (Doctrines &
    Covenants, 132, 20) &mdash; a heresy, if there ever was one, &mdash; but
    rather the creature’s gracious participation in the divine life, a
    participation flowing from, and rendered possible by, the Incarnation
    itself.

From this starting-point he draws a contrast of emphases: Orthodoxy, he
suggests, is more decisively centred upon the Incarnation as the foundation of
salvation, whereas Western Christianity tends to gravitate toward the
Crucifixion and, at times, to treat it in relative isolation; and once the Cross
is construed chiefly as a transaction ordered to the resolution of a determinate
liability—be it described as guilt, punishment, or debt—salvation is readily
redescribed in legal categories, and the familiar question (“what secures the
verdict?”) presses to the fore. It is within this horizon, he argues, that the
indulgence controversy and the Reformation disputes are best understood: not
merely as historical accidents, but as crystallizations of a deeper polemical
tension generated by a narrowed, transactional frame.

That, at least, is the thesis as I heard it, namely, that theosis and
Incarnation are not merely topics within soteriology, but the proper point of
departure, precisely because they set the whole matter within a participatory
model—communion, transformation, healing—rather than within a courtroom
model—verdict, payment, satisfaction; and from this, on his account, the
Orthodox rejection of purgatory follows, inasmuch as purgatory appears to belong
to a juridical soteriology wherein salvation is construed as remission of
penalties and post-mortem purification as the completion of a legal
satisfaction.

## 2. The “forensic versus participatory” opposition is too simple

Strickland’s instinct at this point is not without real force, for anyone who
has attended to popular forms of Western preaching, or who has lingered over
certain late-medieval devotional materials, will readily perceive how easily the
idiom of “debt,” “payment,” and “punishment” may degenerate into a
quasi-commercial imagination of redemption; and once such a construal becomes
habitual, the faith–works dispute can indeed assume an air of near-necessity,
since, if salvation be primarily conceived as a verdict, one is at once
constrained to ask what conditions are annexed to that verdict, how any
remaining penalties are to be discharged, and by what means remission is to be
obtained; so that Strickland’s critique is best understood, not as an objection
to biblical language as such, but as an objection to reduction, namely, to the
tendency whereby one metaphor, originally serviceable within its proper limits,
is permitted to harden into a single controlling model. Yet the remedy cannot be
to oppose “juridical” to “participatory” as though the former were intrinsically
Western, late, or legalistic, and the latter uniquely Eastern, patristic, or
spiritual, for the Christian sources themselves are already irreducibly
pluriform, speaking at once in forensic terms (justification and condemnation,
acquittal and judgment), in cultic terms (sacrifice, offering, priesthood), in
familial terms (adoption and inheritance), in medicinal terms (healing and
illumination), and in participatory terms (union with Christ, life in the
Spirit, incorporation into the Body); nor is this plurality an embarrassment to
be disciplined away by a tidying system, but rather a constitutive feature of
the scriptural witness, since the economy of salvation is too vast to be
exhausted by any single image.

The Apostle Paul, in particular, speaks without embarrassment in juridical
accents, contrasting condemnation and justification, speaking of God as judge,
and deploying the language of law and verdict; and yet the very same Pauline
corpus is everywhere saturated with participatory and transformative claims,
such that the Christian is “in Christ,” Christ lives in the believer, the old
man dies and a new creation arises, believers are incorporated into one body and
animated by one Spirit, and they are conformed to Christ, not merely pronounced
his; whence it follows that the juridical and the participatory are not rival
soteriologies in St. Paul, but concurrent registers within one and the same
proclamation, as the Fathers themselves, when expounding the Pauline theses,
commonly refuse to sever what the Apostle joins[^1].

Precisely here a Catholic clarification is most needed, for the Catholic
tradition does not deny, still less disdain, the participatory horizon which
Strickland associates with theosis, but confesses divinisation and speaks of
sanctifying grace as a true participation in the divine life[^2], a confession
already articulated in patristic form by St. Athanasius[^3] and echoed, in a
cognate register, by St. Irenaeus of Lyons[^4]; yet neither can it simply
renounce forensic language, because such language is not a medieval invention
but apostolic, so that the question is not whether juridical terminology may be
employed, but whether it is permitted to become a self-sufficient and flattening
scheme, whether verdict is made to exclude communion, or acquittal is made to
replace new life. Put differently, the deepest problem is not juridical
categories as such, but legalism; and legalism is not identical with the mere
use of judicial metaphors, since a court may declare what is already the case,
whereas God’s judgment, in the Christian proclamation, is not merely descriptive
but efficacious, such that, when God justifies, he does not merely label but
effects what he declares, because justification is not only remission of sins
but also sanctification and renewal of the interior man[^5], a point which St.
Augustine states with characteristic directness when, distinguishing the
righteousness whereby God is righteous from that righteousness which God
bestows, he speaks of the righteousness “with which he endows man when he
justifies the ungodly”[^6]; and thus the true target is any “transactional”
construal that abstracts verdict from vitality, liability from communion, or
satisfaction from sanctification, while simultaneously forgetting that the
Church condemns, as legalism in the strict sense, any claim that man can be
justified before God by his own works without divine grace through Jesus
Christ.[^7]

Once this is granted, the terrain shifts, for Strickland is right to warn
against construing salvation as a ledger of debts and payments, yet it does not
follow that forensic language is alien to the apostolic mind, nor that the West
is doomed to legalism merely by speaking of justification and judgment; rather,
the question becomes what the proper ordering of the biblical metaphors is, and
what safeguards prevent any one of them from tyrannising the whole, since it is
precisely that question—concerning the controlling grammar and the requisite
guardrails—that will permit a clearer assessment of theosis and Incarnation on
the one hand, and of faith, works, satisfaction, and purgatory on the other.

## 3. Theosis and the Incarnation

Although it has already been conceded that the opposition, as commonly framed,
between the “forensic” and the “participatory” registers is too summary to
sustain, without qualification, the whole burden of a theological diagnosis, it
nevertheless remains necessary to underscore what is most sound and most
fruitful in Strickland’s point of departure, namely, that theosis—participation
in the divine life—is not a speculative embellishment appended at the margin of
Eastern devotion, but rather a native and habitual manner in which many of the
Eastern Fathers articulate salvation, precisely insofar as it draws immediately
upon the apostolic promise that the faithful are made “partakers of the divine
nature”[^8], and thus cannot be reduced to a mere alteration of juridical
status, as though God had only reclassified the sinner by an external decree,
but must be understood as the bestowal of a new life, that is to say, communion
with God, transformation by grace, and incorporation into Christ[^9].

From a Catholic standpoint this emphasis is not alien, since Catholic teaching
not only permits but positively requires that salvation be expounded in
participatory terms, the Catechism of the Catholic Church speaking without
ambiguity of the Incarnation’s purpose in divinising language—“The Word became
flesh to make us ‘partakers of the divine nature’”[^10]—and even adopting, with
due qualification, the patristic idiom that God became man “so that we might
become God,” namely by grace and participation and not by nature, autonomy, or
any imagined transmutation of the creature into the Creator[^11], in a manner
consonant with the classic Fathers whose expressions the Catechism here
receives, such as St. Athanasius[^12] and St. Irenaeus[^13], so that theosis is
not to be treated as an “Orthodox distinctive” set over against Catholic
soteriology, but as part of the common patristic inheritance, expressed with
different accents and under different preferred vocabularies[^14].

By this fact there is corrected, at the outset, a misimpression to which
Strickland’s presentation might inadvertently give occasion, for if the question
be whether Catholicism knows an account of salvation as participation, the
answer is plainly affirmative[^15], whereas if the question be rather why
Eastern theology tends more habitually to lead with communion and
transfiguration, while Western theology has often, especially in polemical
seasons, given prominent place to juridical and sacrificial idioms, then what is
at issue is less a contradiction of doctrine than a difference of rhetorical and
theological prioritisation within the one faith, a diversity which may be
legitimate so long as it remains ordered to the integrity of the apostolic
deposit and does not collapse into reduction[^16].

Accordingly, the contrast sometimes drawn between “Incarnation” and “Cross” is
best received, not as a doctrinal diagnosis, but as a caution against imbalance,
since Catholic doctrine is clear that the Incarnation is not a preliminary scene
set before “the real work” of redemption begins, even while it teaches with
equal clarity that redemption “comes to us above all through the blood of his
cross,” holding together both affirmations when it states that “the mystery of
Christ’s Redemption is at work in a hidden way throughout his entire life” and
yet “comes to us above all through the blood of his cross”[^17], so that the
point is not to attenuate the Cross, but to refuse to sever it from that one
economy in which God unites humanity to himself and heals it from within, a
logic which the Fathers express, in their own manner, when St. Gregory of
Nazianzus insists that what is not assumed is not healed[^18], and when St. Leo
the Great speaks of the believer’s elevation by grace to participation in divine
life through the mystery of the Word made flesh[^19].

If this be granted, then what is strongest in Strickland’s argument may be
retained without conceding what is overstated, for he is right to desire that
salvation be understood as transformative union rather than as mere acquittal,
and Catholics can agree, and indeed must insist, that salvation involves real
incorporation into Christ and real sanctification by grace[^20], the necessary
clarification being only that the Church is not obliged to choose between
registers which Scripture itself employs, since the juridical and sacrificial
language is ordered to serve, and not to supplant, the participatory end for
which humanity is created—communion with God—an end which justification itself,
rightly understood, both presupposes and effects insofar as it is not only
remission but also sanctification and interior renewal[^21].

## 4. Faith, works, transactionalism, and purgatory

With these preliminaries in place, the perennial faith–works question may be
treated with greater exactitude and with less polemical heat, for Rev.
Strickland is correct that the popular contrast—“Protestants say faith alone,
Catholics say faith plus works”—often operates as a serviceable caricature only
by construing “works” as independent inputs by which one purchases
justification, whereas the Council of Trent expressly condemns the claim that a
man may be justified “by his own works … without the grace of God through Jesus
Christ” [^22], and the Catechism of the Catholic Church likewise describes
justification as the gratuitous gift of God’s sanctifying grace, which precedes,
enables, and sustains any salutary human movement[^23].

The more precise Catholic claim, therefore, is not that works compete with grace
as a co-cause, but that faith is not meant to remain a bare and inert assent,
since it is ordered to become living faith, that is, faith “working through
love”[^24], and the works that follow are not a rival principle set alongside
grace but rather the fruit, manifestation, and cooperative expression of grace’s
efficacy in the renewed person[^25]; hence the dispute becomes notably less
confused once one distinguishes (i) the efficient cause of justification, which
is the gratuitous mercy of God in Christ[^26], (ii) the nature of faith as a
living adherence that tends intrinsically toward charity[^27], and (iii) the
place of works, not as purchase-money, but as participatory obedience and
consequent cooperation—real, yet derivative—within a life already quickened by
grace[^28].

At this juncture the term “merit” commonly becomes the stumbling-block, and it
must be said with equal firmness that Catholic doctrine does employ the language
of merit and reward while simultaneously excluding any Pelagian imagination of
autonomous earning, precisely because it intends to safeguard two truths at
once, namely, that God remains the sovereign author of salvation and that the
human person is not saved as a stone is moved but as a living agent whose will
is truly healed, elevated, and enabled to cooperate[^29]; accordingly, when the
Church speaks of “merit,” she means a reality grounded wholly in prior gift, so
that even the reward promised to good works is itself the free completion of
what grace has already begun[^30], which is why St. Augustine can say, in the
very locus most often invoked for this point, that when God “crowns our merits,
He crowns nothing other than His own gifts”[^31].

It is also here that the “transactional” imagery which Strickland critiques
ought to be treated with some discrimination, since there were indeed periods in
which Western preaching and penitential practice, especially at the popular
level and most evidently in connection with abuses, were expressed in
ledger-like terms of debts, satisfactions, remissions, and indulgences spoken of
as though they were spiritual commodities; yet the Church’s doctrinal
guardrails, when stated in their proper form, are markedly non-commercial, for
she defines an indulgence as the remission “before God” of temporal punishment
due to sins already forgiven as to guilt, granted under prescribed conditions
through the Church’s ministry[^32], insists that “temporal punishment” is not to
be conceived as divine vengeance externally inflicted but as a consequence of
sin’s intrinsic disorder that calls for purification, healing, and
detachment[^33], and, in her own authoritative reforms, both condemns “evil
traffic” in indulgences and mandates correction of abuses[^34], while St. Paul
VI states with particular clarity that indulgences “cannot be acquired without a
sincere conversion of mentality (‘metanoia’) and unity with God”[^35].

Purgatory belongs to the same zone of frequent misunderstanding, and thus the
distinction between medieval imaginative literature or popular representations
and the doctrinal nucleus is indispensable, for the Catholic claim is neither
that the saved are “in hell for a while” nor that purgatory constitutes a second
damnation, but rather that those who die in God’s friendship while still
imperfectly purified undergo a final purification, the purpose of which is
precisely the holiness required for communion with God[^36]; in this sense the
doctrine does not compete with theosis but, in a certain respect, protects the
premise that salvation is real transformation, since if sanctification is not a
legal fiction but a true healing and re-formation, then the logic of
purification—whether completed in this life, or, by divine mercy, brought to
completion beyond—follows as a corollary[^37], and the Church, while warning
against speculative curiosities, has given this claim determinate magisterial
articulation, as in the Council of Florence[^38] and again in the sober
disciplinary decree of Trent, which affirms purgatory and directs pastors to
exclude what is “difficult and subtle” or unedifying from popular
instruction[^39].

It should further be observed that the instinct operative here is not wholly
foreign to the Christian East, for the practice of praying for the departed and
entrusting them to God’s mercy presupposes that what remains incomplete in us
may yet be healed by God, and the Catholic Church herself appeals to this
ancient practice when she speaks of “prayers in suffrage for them”[^40], a
practice witnessed with particular explicitness by St. Cyril of Jerusalem, who
teaches, within the eucharistic context, that the commemoration of the departed
brings “a very great benefit to the souls” for whom supplication is
offered[^41], and likewise by St. John Chrysostom, who, while exhorting prayer
and almsgiving on behalf of the dead, remarks that “not in vain did the Apostles
order that remembrance should be made of the dead in the dreadful
Mysteries”[^42]; therefore the disagreement, when stated with due care, is not
simply “purification versus no purification,” but rather concerns how far one
can or ought to define the manner of that purification, and how one prevents
legitimate definition from degenerating into imagery of terror, payment, or
commercial exchange.

One further consideration, commonly remaining tacit beneath these comparisons
yet requiring, if the comparison is to be conducted with intellectual fairness,
to be articulated with some explicitness, is that when Strickland opposes an
Orthodox ease before mystery to certain Western habits of juridical distinction,
he does, at least at the level of theological idiom and customary rhetorical
register, lay hold of something not wholly unreal, inasmuch as many of the
East’s more characteristic voices exhibit an apophatic reticence and a
preference for liturgical and doxological utterance, whereas the Latin
inheritance has often shown a marked inclination toward analytic precision and
conceptual differentiation; yet it would be a palpable non sequitur, drawn
merely from this divergence of verbal temper, to infer either that the West is
therefore “mystery-averse,” or that the very act of distinguishing, as such, is
already tantamount to rationalism, as though intellectual clarity were, by its
nature, inimical to contemplation[^43].

For the Western tradition also is penetrated by an apophatic sensibility
precisely insofar as, while confessing God truly, it insists no less firmly upon
divine incomprehensibility, upon the strict limits of creaturely language, and
upon the necessity of analogical predication: God “transcends all creatures,” so
that speech concerning him must undergo continual purification, and even where
such speech does, by grace, attain to God, it does so without circumscribing
him[^44], indeed under that rule which Catechism of the Catholic Church itself,
by appeal to Fourth Lateran Council, renders in lapidary form, namely, that
“between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an
even greater dissimilitude”[^45]. Its scholastic method—when exercised according
to its proper intention and not in a spirit of arid disputation—was not ordered
to the dissipation of mystery into explanation, but to the removal of confusions
which impede contemplation; and thus, in that same spirit, the Church’s
development of technical terminology is not a capitulation of faith to “human
wisdom,” but an instrument by which an ineffable mystery may be signified as
mystery, “infinitely beyond all that we can humanly understand”[^46].
Accordingly, when the most careful scholastics distinguish, they do so—at least
in principle—not in order to domesticate the divine, but in order to prevent
crude literalism and thereby to safeguard what cannot be comprehended, since, as
St. Thomas Aquinas writes in the *Summa theologiae*, “His essence is above all
that we understand about God, and signify in word”[^47]. Nor is this restraint
absent from the broader Western inheritance, since the confession of God as
“immense” and “incomprehensible” belongs to the Church’s dogmatic lexicon as
such in First Vatican Council’s *Dei Filius*; and the same reverent inhibition
is voiced with memorable directness by St. Augustine, who, in *Sermo* 117,
warns: “If you comprehend, it is not God.”

Accordingly, the point may most charitably be stated as a difference of habitual
temperaments of expression, rather than as a difference between “mystery” and
“clarity” as such, for the danger attendant upon the Western temperament is
reduction—when metaphor is treated as mechanism, or when juridical language,
taken out of its proper theological subordination, is permitted to eclipse
communion—whereas the danger attendant upon the Eastern temperament, when
caricatured or misapplied, can be a suspicion of precision as such, as though
clarity were always a betrayal of mystery; yet mystery and clarity are not
enemies, because Christian doctrine does not presume to comprehend God
exhaustively, but seeks to confess truly what God has revealed, and it does so
in such a manner that worship is guarded from distortion and the Gospel
proclaimed without confusion, a task which—precisely because it is ministerial
rather than domineering—belongs to the Church’s living teaching office, which,
as Second Vatican Council teaches in *Dei Verbum*, is “not above the word of
God, but serv[ing] it”[^48]. In this same register, the Church’s sacramental
life—Latin no less than Byzantine—remains a continual pedagogy of the visible
bearing the invisible, since the sacraments are “efficacious signs of grace”
whose visible rites “signify and make present” what they confer[^49].

<section markdown="1">

Strickland’s proem—Incarnation, then theosis—is plainly intended to displace, as
the controlling grammar of redemption, a narrowed courtroom model in which
verdict, payment, and satisfaction are permitted to function as the principal
explanatory keys, and to restore, as the governing horizon, that
communion-and-transformation model in which participation and healing are
determinative; upon that fundamental point a Catholic may readily concur, since
the Word did truly become flesh in order that man might become “a partaker of
the divine nature”[^50], and since grace is not to be conceived as a bare
remission external to the subject, but as an efficacious gift whereby man is
inwardly renewed and made capable of a new life in Christ[^51]. If, moreover,
certain strands of Western preaching or devotional habit have, at times, given
the impression that salvation is chiefly a matter of spiritual accounting, and
that the drama of redemption is to be narrated as though it were principally a
transaction, the critique is not without a real object, and Catholics need not
deny those historical pathologies by which such caricatures have sometimes been
rendered plausible.

Where clarification is required is in the implied opposition between a
“participatory East” and a “juridical West,” as though the latter were
intrinsically legalistic, or as though its juridical idiom were essentially
post-schism; for the Christian sources themselves speak in multiple registers,
and Holy Scripture—St. Paul above all—employs judicial metaphors without
embarrassment, while simultaneously proclaiming a salvation that is, in its
substance, participatory and transformative, consisting in incorporation into
Christ, life in the Spirit, and conformity to the Son[^52]. The issue,
therefore, is not whether forensic language may be used, but whether any one
register is permitted to tyrannise the whole—whether verdict is abstracted from
communion, whether satisfaction is detached from sanctification, and whether
“punishment” language is severed from its proper end in purification and
healing[^53].

Read with those guardrails in view, much of Strickland’s critique can be
received as a warning against reduction rather than as a verdict against
Catholic doctrine itself; for Catholic teaching, taken on its own terms, is not
“faith plus works” in the sense of a competitive addition, nor is it a denial of
theosis, but rather a confession that justification is sheer gift, effected by
grace through Christ[^54], that faith, if genuine, becomes living faith through
charity[^55], that works are the fruit and the graced cooperation of the renewed
person rather than an independent currency[^56], and that whatever “merit” there
is is first God’s gift and only secondarily man’s response[^57]. Even the
disputed loci—indulgences, purgatory—are, in their doctrinal core, not
mechanisms for purchasing salvation but claims concerning the Church’s
intercession and the final purification of those already saved, however much
their historical administration has sometimes obscured that intent[^58].

The remaining disagreements, then, are best located not in a crude “Incarnation
versus Cross” contrast, nor in the suggestion that one tradition has mystery
while the other has legalism, but in questions of emphasis and governance: which
conceptual grammar ought to lead; how far dogmatic definition should proceed;
how later Latin terms (justification, satisfaction, merit, purgatory,
indulgences) are to be interpreted and hedged; and—beyond the scope of this
note—how questions of ecclesial authority and conciliarity are to be
adjudicated. If the aim is genuine understanding rather than polemical victory,
it seems wiser to grant what is shared (participation in divine life, grace,
real transformation[^59]) and thereafter to dispute, with patience and
precision, where the traditions diverge in articulation.

One might even say that Strickland’s argument, when purified of its sharper
contrasts, can serve as a salutary reminder to Catholics: to speak of
justification and satisfaction only in a manner transparently ordered to
participation, sanctification, and union with God[^60]; to ensure that juridical
metaphors remain servants rather than masters; and to present the Cross not as
an isolated transaction but as the climactic moment of the one economy in which
the Incarnate Son heals human nature by assuming it, offering it, and raising it
into divine life[^61]. If that is the horizon, then the conversation with
Orthodoxy becomes less a contest between rival soteriologies and more a
sustained effort to confess, in complementary idioms, the one salvation given in
Christ.
