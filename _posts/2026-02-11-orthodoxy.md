Yesterday I was listening to an
[episode](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2025/02/12/episode-318-orthodox-questions-with-father-john-strickland-part-1/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}
of Robin Pierson's <em>History of Byzantium</em> featuring a conversation
between the host and Rev. John Strickland, an Orthodox priest and scholar, on
some of the more common questions touching Orthodoxy as it is practised and
understood by its faithful. Although I possess some general acquaintance with
their beliefs and their liturgy — bearing in mind, of course, that for nearly a
millennium the Orthodox and the Catholic shared the same apostolic faith, and
judging moreover, if I may speak with candour, that the divergences which issued
in schism appear, when viewed across the longer tract of time and from the
remove of several centuries, to have depended more upon politics and the
contingencies of history than upon theology; or at the very least, without
downplaying whatever real theological differences arose and continue to separate
the two churches, to have been exacerbated rather by geographical separation and
by the politics of the age — I remain, alas, no more than this: an outsider,
neither myself Orthodox nor a scholar of Orthodoxy.

## 1. Rev. Strickland&rsquo;s thesis

Of that exchange there remain to me, in memory, two points above all, the first touching soteriology, inasmuch as, when he speaks of faith and salvation, Strickland contends that the Catholic West, by a gradual habituation, became increasingly disposed toward legalisms and toward those fine distinctions which arise, almost of necessity, when the matter is prosecuted in a juridical idiom, whereas the Orthodox, as he would have it, are more content to leave certain questions within the province of mystery; and thus it comes about, he says, that the polemical disputes of the Reformation, so commonly cast in the antithesis of “faith alone” and “faith plus works,” remain, for the Orthodox mind, largely alien, precisely because such disputes presuppose a forensic register which, on his account, developed in the West after the schism. The second point concerns purgatory, which the Orthodox reject; and in that connexion he mentions also the Orthodox notion of aerial toll-houses—something which I recall having heard before—while taking care to qualify it as not, strictly speaking, a doctrine in its own right, but rather a pious opinion, a θεολογούμενον.

The core of Strickland’s argument, however, is not an excursus upon post-mortem states, but a proposal touching the very grammar in which salvation is to be spoken of; for he maintains, first, that Orthodoxy does not, properly speaking, enter into that post-Reformation controversy so often prosecuted under the headings of “faith alone” and “faith and works,” and this for the plain reason that the controversy itself is born within a Western polemical field and tends, by its own internal logic, to be carried on in a forensic key, wherein justification is construed as verdict, salvation as acquittal, and penance and satisfaction as liabilities and remissions. Orthodoxy, he says, if pressed to speak into that debate, will indeed insist upon faith in Jesus Christ as central and indispensable, and yet it will resist any neat disjunction between faith and works, since the two are not competing currencies but inseparable aspects of a single life in Christ.

Accordingly, Strickland renders the Orthodox account of salvation, not in forensic categories, but under the rubric of _theosis_ (deification), by which he intends, not that deification sometimes imputed to the Latter-day Saints, as though man were to become god in an autonomous or self-originating manner (a heresy, if there ever was one), but rather the creature’s gracious participation in the divine life, a participation flowing from, and rendered possible by, the Incarnation itself; for because the Word has assumed human nature, humanity can, by grace, be made a participant in God’s own life. Faith and works, therefore, do not admit of any clean separation, inasmuch as faith, precisely by its own nature, must disclose itself in works of love, not as though works were an additional mechanism set alongside faith, but as the enacted form in which faith subsists.

From this starting-point Strickland proceeds to draw a contrast of emphases, suggesting that Orthodoxy is more decisively centred upon the Incarnation as the foundation of salvation, whereas Western Christianity tends to gravitate toward the Crucifixion and, at times, to treat it in a comparatively isolated manner; and once the Cross is construed chiefly as a transaction intended to resolve a determinate liability—whether described as guilt, punishment, or debt—salvation is readily redescribed in legal categories, within which register the familiar question, “what secures the verdict?”, naturally forces its way to the fore, whether it be faith alone, or faith together with works, and, if works be introduced, whether they are meritorious, instrumental, merely evidential, and the like. It is within this horizon, he suggests, that the indulgence controversy and the Reformation disputes are best grasped, not merely as historical accidents, but as crystallizations of a deeper polemical tension generated by a narrowed, transactional frame.

That, at least, is the thesis as I heard it, namely, that theosis and Incarnation are not merely topics within soteriology, but the proper point of departure, precisely because they set the whole matter within a participatory model—communion, transformation, healing—rather than within a courtroom model—verdict, payment, satisfaction; and from this, on his account, the Orthodox rejection of purgatory follows as a downstream implication, inasmuch as purgatory appears to belong to a juridical soteriology wherein salvation is construed as remission of penalties and post-mortem purification as the completion of a legal satisfaction.

## 2. The “forensic versus participatory” opposition is too simple

Strickland’s instinct at this point is not without real force, for anyone who has attended to popular forms of Western preaching, or who has lingered over certain late-medieval devotional materials, will readily perceive how easily the idiom of “debt,” “payment,” and “punishment” may degenerate into a quasi-commercial imagination of redemption; and once such a construal becomes habitual, the faith–works dispute can indeed assume an air of near-necessity, since, if salvation be primarily conceived as a verdict, one is at once constrained to ask what conditions are annexed to that verdict, how any remaining penalties are to be discharged, and by what means remission is to be obtained; so that Strickland’s critique is best understood, not as an objection to biblical language as such, but as an objection to reduction, namely, to the tendency whereby one metaphor, originally serviceable within its proper limits, is permitted to harden into a single controlling model. Yet the remedy cannot be to oppose “juridical” to “participatory” as though the former were intrinsically Western, late, or legalistic, and the latter uniquely Eastern, patristic, or spiritual, for the Christian sources themselves are already irreducibly pluriform, speaking at once in forensic terms (justification and condemnation, acquittal and judgment), in cultic terms (sacrifice, offering, priesthood), in familial terms (adoption and inheritance), in medicinal terms (healing and illumination), and in participatory terms (union with Christ, life in the Spirit, incorporation into the Body); nor is this plurality an embarrassment to be disciplined away by a tidying system, but rather a constitutive feature of the scriptural witness, since the economy of salvation is too vast to be exhausted by any single image.

The Apostle Paul, in particular, speaks without embarrassment in juridical accents, contrasting condemnation and justification, speaking of God as judge, and deploying the language of law and verdict; and yet the very same Pauline corpus is everywhere saturated with participatory and transformative claims, such that the Christian is “in Christ,” Christ lives in the believer, the old man dies and a new creation arises, believers are incorporated into one body and animated by one Spirit, and they are conformed to Christ, not merely pronounced his; whence it follows that the juridical and the participatory are not rival soteriologies in St. Paul, but concurrent registers within one and the same proclamation, as the Fathers themselves, when expounding the Pauline theses, commonly refuse to sever what the Apostle joins[^1].

Precisely here a Catholic clarification is most needed, for the Catholic tradition does not deny, still less disdain, the participatory horizon which Strickland associates with theosis, but confesses divinisation and speaks of sanctifying grace as a true participation in the divine life[^2], a confession already articulated in patristic form by St. Athanasius[^3] and echoed, in a cognate register, by St. Irenaeus of Lyons[^4]; yet neither can it simply renounce forensic language, because such language is not a medieval invention but apostolic, so that the question is not whether juridical terminology may be employed, but whether it is permitted to become a self-sufficient and flattening scheme, whether verdict is made to exclude communion, or acquittal is made to replace new life. Put differently, the deepest problem is not juridical categories as such, but legalism; and legalism is not identical with the mere use of judicial metaphors, since a court may declare what is already the case, whereas God’s judgment, in the Christian proclamation, is not merely descriptive but efficacious, such that, when God justifies, he does not merely label but effects what he declares, because justification is not only remission of sins but also sanctification and renewal of the interior man[^5], a point which St. Augustine states with characteristic directness when, distinguishing the righteousness whereby God is righteous from that righteousness which God bestows, he speaks of the righteousness “with which he endows man when he justifies the ungodly”[^6]; and thus the true target is any “transactional” construal that abstracts verdict from vitality, liability from communion, or satisfaction from sanctification, while simultaneously forgetting that the Church condemns, as legalism in the strict sense, any claim that man can be justified before God by his own works without divine grace through Jesus Christ.[^7]

Once this is granted, the terrain shifts, for Strickland is right to warn against construing salvation as a ledger of debts and payments, yet it does not follow that forensic language is alien to the apostolic mind, nor that the West is doomed to legalism merely by speaking of justification and judgment; rather, the question becomes what the proper ordering of the biblical metaphors is, and what safeguards prevent any one of them from tyrannising the whole, since it is precisely that question—concerning the controlling grammar and the requisite guardrails—that will permit a clearer assessment of theosis and Incarnation on the one hand, and of faith, works, satisfaction, and purgatory on the other.

## 3. Theosis and the Incarnation

Although it has already been conceded that the opposition, as commonly framed, between the “forensic” and the “participatory” registers is too summary to sustain, without qualification, the whole burden of a theological diagnosis, it nevertheless remains necessary to underscore what is most sound and most fruitful in Strickland’s point of departure, namely, that theosis—participation in the divine life—is not a speculative embellishment appended at the margin of Eastern devotion, but rather a native and habitual manner in which many of the Eastern Fathers articulate salvation, precisely insofar as it draws immediately upon the apostolic promise that the faithful are made “partakers of the divine nature”[^8], and thus cannot be reduced to a mere alteration of juridical status, as though God had only reclassified the sinner by an external decree, but must be understood as the bestowal of a new life, that is to say, communion with God, transformation by grace, and incorporation into Christ[^9].

From a Catholic standpoint this emphasis is not alien, since Catholic teaching not only permits but positively requires that salvation be expounded in participatory terms, the Catechism of the Catholic Church speaking without ambiguity of the Incarnation’s purpose in divinising language—“The Word became flesh to make us ‘partakers of the divine nature’”[^10]—and even adopting, with due qualification, the patristic idiom that God became man “so that we might become God,” namely by grace and participation and not by nature, autonomy, or any imagined transmutation of the creature into the Creator[^11], in a manner consonant with the classic Fathers whose expressions the Catechism here receives, such as St. Athanasius[^12] and St. Irenaeus[^13], so that theosis is not to be treated as an “Orthodox distinctive” set over against Catholic soteriology, but as part of the common patristic inheritance, expressed with different accents and under different preferred vocabularies[^14].

By this fact there is corrected, at the outset, a misimpression to which Strickland’s presentation might inadvertently give occasion, for if the question be whether Catholicism knows an account of salvation as participation, the answer is plainly affirmative[^15], whereas if the question be rather why Eastern theology tends more habitually to lead with communion and transfiguration, while Western theology has often, especially in polemical seasons, given prominent place to juridical and sacrificial idioms, then what is at issue is less a contradiction of doctrine than a difference of rhetorical and theological prioritisation within the one faith, a diversity which may be legitimate so long as it remains ordered to the integrity of the apostolic deposit and does not collapse into reduction[^16].

Accordingly, the contrast sometimes drawn between “Incarnation” and “Cross” is best received, not as a doctrinal diagnosis, but as a caution against imbalance, since Catholic doctrine is clear that the Incarnation is not a preliminary scene set before “the real work” of redemption begins, even while it teaches with equal clarity that redemption “comes to us above all through the blood of his cross,” holding together both affirmations when it states that “the mystery of Christ’s Redemption is at work in a hidden way throughout his entire life” and yet “comes to us above all through the blood of his cross” (CCC 517; cf. CCC 512–515; CCC 571–618), so that the point is not to attenuate the Cross, but to refuse to sever it from that one economy in which God unites humanity to himself and heals it from within, a logic which the Fathers express, in their own manner, when St. Gregory of Nazianzus insists that what is not assumed is not healed (Ep. 101.5), and when St. Leo the Great speaks of the believer’s elevation by grace to participation in divine life through the mystery of the Word made flesh (Sermo 21.2).

If this be granted, then what is strongest in Strickland’s argument may be retained without conceding what is overstated, for he is right to desire that salvation be understood as transformative union rather than as mere acquittal, and Catholics can agree, and indeed must insist, that salvation involves real incorporation into Christ and real sanctification by grace (CCC 1265–1266; CCC 1989–1991), the necessary clarification being only that the Church is not obliged to choose between registers which Scripture itself employs, since the juridical and sacrificial language is ordered to serve, and not to supplant, the participatory end for which humanity is created—communion with God—an end which justification itself, rightly understood, both presupposes and effects insofar as it is not only remission but also sanctification and interior renewal (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, Decretum de iustificatione, cap. 7; CCC 1990–1991; CCC 1999).
