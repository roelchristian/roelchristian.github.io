The boys would line up at the gate after school simply for the pleasure of seeing his face (hidden under the bowler hat he refused to take off) grow restless—almost mad—as it scanned their own. ‘We confess,’ they would taunt him, ‘we confess, father,’ then laugh, even after he had walked a distance from them, his hands in his ears.
