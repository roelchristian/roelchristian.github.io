    <h2>Yo wo komete</h2>


<div class="hangind">


    <p>What do I even know? I an old whore,</p>
    <p>Not even a courtesan to some lowly prince:</p>
    <p>Face painted, at home in the shadows,</p>
    <p>By candlelight my scars are barely visible.</p>
    <p>The light escondeth our flaws, makes us</p>
    <p>Acceptable, presentable, -- admirable even</p>
    <p>In the best of nights. I whisper only to those</p>
    <p>Who have ears, my voice, being old, is frail</p>
    <p>And my tongue commandeth no venom.</p>
    <p>But it is late, and although still wrapped in</p>
    <p>Night, too long have you already lingered</p>
    <p>Here: the air is cold and heavy. There is</p>
    <p>Snow on the roof of the houses at the village,</p>
    <p>A pity they spoil the moonlight. I am myself</p>
    <p>Now only shadow, my thin figure not a dance</p>
    <p>But a spasm in this paper wall. I have told</p>
    <p>You all that I know, all that I remember. I fear</p>
    <p>No longer the blade you muster, I fear no more</p>
    <p>Your taunts. If it shall be, then I ask you only</p>
    <p>Swiftness in the exercise of your justice,</p>
    <p>Not even mercy which I do not dare imagine</p>
    <p>I merit, I an old whore in the shadows.</p>

            <p>Carnifex I surrender my many sons to your hands,</p>
            <p>Show mercy, just this once: are we not all flesh,</p>
            <p>all children of the same earth, all sons of the same</p>
            <p>Great Mother who commandeth us to fraternize and</p>
            <p>Multiply in ardor on this sullen shore? When young</p>
            <p>I thought to live two centuries, even three: in folly</p>
            <p>To serve master of all Asia, as far even as the</p>
            <p>Mouth of the Don, a leader among men. I was</p>
            <p>Young, you must forgive me. And I die now but a</p>
            <p>Child, petulant still, my voice quaking as only a</p>
            <p>Wretch’s can, or one who hath avoided death</p>
            <p>Too long, believing himself invincible. Now the</p>
            <p>Revelation that no single bone in my body is</p>
            <p>Holy mocks me and will mock me to the last second.</p>
