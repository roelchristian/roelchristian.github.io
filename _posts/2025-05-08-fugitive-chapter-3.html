        The following is from a draft written in 2015 or thereabouts, inspired,
        if memory serves me right, by the opening scene of Pasternak's <em>Dr
        Zhivago</em>.

        In the schoolroom at Charnost, winter settled not simply as a season but
        as a temperament, a long accretion of silence and condensation through
        which time passed with the softness of dripping limewater. The walls,
        which might once have held colour, had long since surrendered to the
        subtle tyranny of damp, and the sole concession to splendour was a cheap
        chromolithograph of Franz Joseph, issued for the Golden Jubilee of 1898,
        its gaudy inks already fading to the colour of weak tea; the pine frame
        listed slightly to starboard, as though the Emperor himself wished, even
        here in this provincial classroom, to quit the scene discreetly. Aleksi,
        seated three rows from the stove, had long since learned to close his
        eyes during dictation, not in defiance but in pursuit of another air. In
        these moments he would be, not in Charnost, but perched aon the chalk
        cliffs above Balchik—though in later years he wondered whether the scene
        was merely a mnemonic graft from a Sunday postcard of Varna pinned long
        ago to his aunt’s dresser mirror,—standing beside the very aunt in the
        evening wind. He had imagined this so often that it had acquired the
        weight of memory—of the kind that settles over one’s early years and
        which, though unverifiable, is not therefore untrue. Later in life, he
        would come to suspect that most of his childhood had been made up of
        such half-dreams: recollections of places never visited, of faces never
        quite resolved. Herr Karoly’s voice would then cut in sharply, and
        Aleksi would open his eyes again to the gritty smell of chalk, the
        bluish cast of the window frost, and the faint rustle of twenty other
        children shifting on hard benches. Karoly, at this time of year, was
        less severe than usual. Perhaps it was the cold in his joints, or the
        peculiar hush that winter lays over even the most pedantic spirits. His
        punishments, when they came, were muted, his rebukes more abstract. He
        had the habit, inherited perhaps from his days in Heidelberg, of quoting
        whole passages in languages no longer taught in the school—passages
        which, heard only half-comprehended, drifted through the classroom like
        incense at a funeral. Outside, the early snow had long since collapsed
        into greyness. The schoolyard was covered in churned slush and yellowed
        ice, and from the upper windows one could see the bare trees sagging
        with the effort of their own exposure. There was little to do but to
        wait—wait for the sun to return, for the stove to be stoked, for the
        lessons to end, and for the evening meal which, despite its sameness,
        offered a kind of punctuation. In those long months Aleksi learned to
        endure not through courage but through the cultivation of a quiet
        interiority. It was a method that would remain with him into adulthood,
        and which he would later recognise in the characters of certain novels—a
        method of retreat rather than revolt.

       Herr Karoly’s past, though seldom spoken of in full, was known in
       fragments. He was said to be the son of a Hungarian Jew who had made his
       way eastward from Vienna after inheriting a disputed estate in the
       margins of the crownlands. The property, an overgrown farm with a
       crumbling outbuilding and a neglected orchard, had been promised in an
       uncle’s will but had passed through so many legal intermediaries that, by
       the time it came into the family’s hands, it had lost all traces of its
       former usefulness. Karoly’s father, a man of fastidious habits and thin
       wrists, had left the capital with a railway ticket, a book of Psalms, and
       a faint belief that the countryside might still contain something
       unspoiled. He found instead silence, thick mud, and an endless procession
       of petty debts. There are photographs—sepia and curling at the corners—of
       the wedding: Karoly’s father in a suit two years out of fashion, his
       bride with her hair tied back in the manner of the Székely peasantry,
       staring not at him but just over his left shoulder. The marriage had been
       a matter of practicality; of affection, there is little evidence. In the
       only surviving letter from that period, the elder Karoly writes of “a
       yearning for the ordinary,” and then says no more. His early instruction
       was entrusted to a pale Thuringian widow whose German was mottled with
       local dialect and who, lacking sturdier pedagogical tools, intoned the
       simpler Lieder of Matthias Claudius—verses lifted from well-thumbed
       almanacs and delivered with a piety ordinarily reserved for the rosary.
       From this, and from the habit of prolonged observation, Karoly acquired
       his bearing: formal, aloof, and faintly theatrical. As a boy he had once
       drawn a portrait of Marcus Aurelius in his copybook and beneath it
       written, in large uneven capitals, the phrase: I wish to be governed by
       reason. The teacher at the time had taken it for insolence. When the
       funds permitted, he was sent to Heidelberg, where he studied engineering
       without enthusiasm. What impressed him more than the lectures were the
       melancholy promenades along the Neckar, the smell of damp parchment in
       the seminar library, and the low voice of a girl from Karlsruhe who
       quoted Heine without affectation. He did not finish his degree on time.

        He returned to Charnost just before the turn of the century. In an
        optimistic spring before the century’s turn a pair of local
        entrepreneurs laid some second-hand rails for a horse-drawn trolley,
        whose worn bell still hung, unusably, from a larch post; by the time
        Karoly returned, the car had been sold for scrap and the track lay
        half-buried under meadow grasses, so that its very existence seemed one
        more provincial rumour. A vacancy had appeared at the
        Bezirks-Volks-schule, that modest parish institution whose iron stove
        dated, so townspeople said, from the revolutions of ’48; the appointment
        promised little more than coal money and a title scarcely worth
        embroidering on a visiting card, yet Karoly, having nowhere else to
        turn, accepted it without demur. His habits were simple and largely
        immutable. He walked each day at the same hour, taking the northern
        route past the neglected garden plots and the Lutheran churchyard. He
        wore a greatcoat even in spring. He was observed once at the station
        reading a French edition of La Tempête while the freight train wheezed
        past, unmoved by the commotion. He lived alone in rooms above the
        cooper’s shop. The ceiling plaster was cracked, and the curtains faded
        to a colourless shade that might once have been ochre. Somewhere about
        1909, after a furtive trip to Vienna, he returned with a hand-cranked
        Berliner disc machine—already a little out of fashion in the capital—and
        a single record, Bach’s second Brandenburg arranged for salon orchestra;
        evenings he would lower the steel needle with ceremonial care, and the
        room, otherwise given over to the scraping of branches against the
        eaves, filled with that poised Allegro whose fragile surface wore
        thinner with each revolution. He subscribed to no newspapers. His
        handwriting, when he marked the children's papers, was narrow and
        upright, and bore a curious resemblance to that found in judicial
        records of the earlier century. The children both feared and pitied him.
        They knew, without knowing how, that he belonged to a time that was
        already passing.

    </p>

    <p> 
        In the spring, with the coming of the thaw, Karoly's manner turned rigid
        again. On the first Monday of Lent he struck a girl named Angela on the
        hands for failing to recite her sums. Aleksi watched from the third
        bench. The stick—a thin ruler worn smooth at the edge—fell three times.
        Angela did not cry. Her fingers turned a deep red and remained so until
        the afternoon. No one spoke to her at recess. There was an
        understanding, as among animals after a storm, that silence was safer.
        But by the end of the week, she had become the subject of hushed
        fascination. Angela, whom no one had looked at twice before, now moved
        with a kind of solemn grandeur, recounting her story with variations
        depending on the listener. Andros, the baker’s son, said flatly that she
        was stupid and deserved it. He threw a snowball at her that missed and
        then tried to laugh. But no one joined him. Later, when they walked
        home, Aleksi noticed that Andros still held the snowball in his hand,
        now half-melted, as though reluctant to be rid of it. As they neared the
        edge of town, he let it fall onto the road without a sound. No one
        remembered precisely when Karoly stopped teaching. One morning he was
        simply absent, and after a few weeks, his name ceased to appear on the
        timetable. Rumour had it that he had returned to Vienna, or to Lemberg,
        or to no place at all. The rooms above the cooper’s shop were later let
        to a travelling dentist. The curtains were replaced. Years later,
        Aleksi, walking through that same quarter in winter, paused at the sound
        of a gramophone playing, distantly, what may have been Bach. But it was
        impossible to be sure. The window was shut, and the snow had begun to
        fall again.

    </p>

    <p>
        Even then, there was a kind of muted solemnity to it all, as though they
        had already begun to mourn what they were only now beginning to
        experience. Their laughter—nervous, half-smothered by the reeds—was not
        the laughter of boys entirely unaware of themselves, but rather of boys
        who had begun to suspect that their own joy might be temporary, or
        worse, watched. Somewhere on the other side of the trees, in the
        direction of the gendarmerie road, an ox cart creaked along slowly, and
        the bell on its harness gave off a mournful chime that made them still
        for a moment, until Andros called for a race, and the spell was broken.
        Aleksi remembered it less in images than in textures: the way sunlight
        filtered through the trembling canopy, turning the water’s surface into
        a lattice of gold and brass; the strange smell of algae and boyhood
        perspiration, of moss warmed by the sun; the slight embarrassment,
        unspoken, of their pale limbs brushing underwater; and how Pavel, his
        face for once completely unguarded, had turned toward him with an
        expression of such sincere and fleeting pleasure that Aleksi had the
        impulse, not quite explainable then or since, to reach out and steady
        him—though nothing, in that moment, had been unsteady. But all things
        bend toward dissolution. What remained most vivid, as time passed and
        the boyhood afternoons gave way to duller seasons, was not the sensation
        of joy but its violation—its slipping, its retreat. For that same
        summer, sometime not long after the river days had ended, Herr Karoly
        had, in a manner which now seemed rehearsed, resumed his quiet pursuit
        of Pavel.

    </p>
    <p>
        It began with questions in class directed always to him, increasingly
        rhetorical in nature, framed as if to flatter but really to test: You
        must know this, Pavel. Is it not obvious to you? And when he answered
        correctly, the others were made to suffer, and if incorrectly, it was
        followed by a silence more terrible than rebuke. Aleksi, who had long
        grown used to Karoly’s sardonic eye, began to feel a faint revulsion
        stir in him. He saw now that Karoly had not loved Pavel, not really, but
        had only seen in him a piece of himself that he wished to preserve in
        glass—a specimen of melancholy and intellect, uncorrupted by
        camaraderie. Pavel, for his part, noticed little. Or rather, he noticed
        and dismissed. It was as if the shadow of Karoly had grown faint in the
        presence of something more powerful—friendship, yes, but something
        stranger too, something almost ritualistic in its progression. Their
        games had become more obscure, their pacts more complex. They began to
        invent stories about each other’s pasts, not to deceive but to deepen
        some imagined narrative of their own becoming. Pavel claimed he had once
        lived in Budapest and had seen the Danube rise past the chains of the
        suspension bridge. Andros said his uncle was a cavalryman who had
        duelled with a Russian officer in Bukovina. Aleksi remained silent, half
        in doubt, half in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
        At school, their unity gave them a peculiar immunity. Karoly no longer
        punished Pavel, but ignored him, and this—more than his earlier
        favour—set Pavel apart. The others, noting his fall from grace, became
        kind to him in ways they could not have been before. In fall, they would
        give him the best chalk, or let him cheat from their copybooks, or stand
        beside him during the morning roll call. It was as if, by being cast out
        of Karoly’s strange affection, he had returned to them in full. And yet
        something had changed. Pavel still spoke of boredom, but the tone was no
        longer bitter. It had become ceremonial, like the repetition of a minor
        key before a cadence. He had grown taller that year, and when the school
        photograph was taken under the low wooden awning in October, he stood at
        the back, arms folded, his mouth drawn in what might have been a smile.

    </p>
    <p>
        Herr Karoly, in that photograph, sits in the centre, hat on knee, a
        faint smudge of chalk on his cuff. His face betrays nothing. But when
        Aleksi found the photo again years later in the attic of the
        now-demolished schoolhouse—tucked behind a ledger of enrolments and
        water-damaged sketches of the Austro-Hungarian coat of arms—he saw in
        Karoly’s eyes something he had never noticed before: not sadness
        exactly, nor regret, but a kind of exhausted recognition, as if caught
        in the instant of realising that his creation—his boy—had outgrown him,
        and that all his careful cruelty, his weary brilliance, had come to
        nothing. Much later, some further details surfaced. Rumour later placed
        him variously: boarding with a cousin in Fünfkirchen among the limestone
        escarpments of southern Transdanubia, or keeping a back room in Pozsony,
        where the lanes already bore bilingual name-plates that would soon be
        prised off and repainted.

    </p>
    <p>
        The boys themselves scattered gradually. Andros enlisted in the army and
        was killed on manoeuvres in Galicia in the early spring of 1914, though
        this Aleksi only learned much later. Pavel disappeared from records
        shortly after that, and despite inquiries, no one could say where he had
        gone—only that he had left without a farewell, as if the act of
        vanishing was, for him, the final proof of a life truly his own. Aleksi,
        older now than Karoly ever was when he taught them, would sometimes wake
        in early winter with the image of a boy’s back glinting wet beneath a
        canopy of trees, the air still warm, the water still good, the green
        schoolpants hung like pennants on a crooked branch, and with a
        sensation—not of loss—but of something unfinished, still waiting to be
        explained.
