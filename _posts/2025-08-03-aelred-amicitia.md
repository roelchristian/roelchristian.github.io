Aelred of Rievaulx, [_De spirituali amicitia_](/references#aelred_amicitia),
cap. II.
{: .mb-3 }


<section markdown="1">

_Ael._ Amicitia igitur ipsa virtus est qua talis dilectionis ac dulcedinis
foedere ipsi animi copulantur, et efficiuntur unum de pluribus. Unde ipsam
amicitiam non inter fortuita vel caduca, sed inter ipsas virtutes quae aeternae
sunt, etiam mundi huius philosophi collocarunt. Quibus Salomon in proverbiis
consentire videtur: «Omni, inquiens, tempore diligit qui amicus est» ([_Prov._
XVII,
17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2017%3A17&version=VULGATE){:
target="_blank" rel="noopener"}); manifeste declarans amicitiam aeternam esse,
si vera est; si autem esse desierit, nec veram fuisse cum videretur existere.
... et ut ait noster Hieronymus: «Amicitia quae desinere potest, numquam vera
fuit» ([_Epist._ 41, _ad Ruffin._](/references#jerome_letters))[^locus]

[^locus]: This locus is taken verbatim from the text at the [Latin
    Library](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/), which I have not been able to
    verify independently against a critical edition. Braceland (cf. _infra_)
    cites it as _Ep._ 3, following the numbering used in the translation by
    Fremantle et al. in the _Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers_, Second Series.


_Ivo._ Ergo ne inter amicitiam et caritatem nihil distare arbitramur?

_Ael._ Immo plurimum. Multo enim plures gremio caritatis quam
amicitiaeamplexibus recipiendos, divina sanxit auctoritas. Non enim amicos
solum, sed et inimicos sinu dilectionis excipere, caritatis lege compellimur
([Matth. V,
44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A44&version=VULGATE){:
target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). Amicos autem eos solos dicimus, quibus cor
nostrum, et quidquid in illo est, committere non formidamus; illis vicissim
nobis, eadem fidei lege et securitate constrictis.

Braceland.[^trans]
{: .mb-3 }

[^trans]: The translation numbers this passage as §§&nbsp;21, 24, 31–32
    (lib.&nbsp;I). The gaps reflect the sections I omitted from my citation.


_Ael._ Friendship is that virtue, therefore, through which by a covenant of
sweetest love our very spirits are united, and from many are made one. Hence
even the philosophers of this world placed friendship not among the accidents of
mortal life but among the virtues that are eternal. Solomon seems to agree with
them in this verse from Proverbs: “a friend loves always.” So he obviously
declares that friendship is eternal if it is true, but if it ceases to exist,
then although it seemed to exist, it was not true friendship. ... And as our
Jerome says, “a friendship that can end was never true.”
{: .noindent }

_Ivo._ Are we to conclude, then, that there is no distinction between friendship
and charity

_Ael._ On the contrary, the greatest distinction! Divine authority commands that
many more be received to the clasp of charity than to the embrace of friendship.
By the law of charity we are ordered to welcome into the bosom of love not only
our friends but also our enemies. But we call friends only those to whom we have
no qualm about entrusting our heart and all its contents, while these friends
are bound to us in turn by the same inviolable law of loyalty and
trustworthiness.
