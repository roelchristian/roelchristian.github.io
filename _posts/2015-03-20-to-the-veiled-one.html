	<p>You left a promise under my doorstep
	<p>To remain urbane under the white walls and white ceilings of distant
	<p>Seas I shall not know; handwritten in the creamcoloured paper you have in
	<p>Reams; intimate; pleading; yet I would rather believe the adage
	<p>From a fortune cookie from a London
	<p>Coffeehouse I went to last summer—
	<p>‘What is trivial is true is beautiful’—
	<p>Which does not pretend to care.
	<p>The blue ink would not
	<p>Hinder the catharsis of so many
	<p>Long nights, so many withered flowers
	<p>Protruding from the desperate floral foam which I do not even wish to see again.
	<p>Damp the stalks, more alive than the leaves now crumbling the petals now turned to dust
	<p>While in my bedroom the telephone rings eternally,
	<p>And the lights will never go out.

	<p>From the peeping hole I see your face
	<p>Urbane even among the pirates of white rooms in
	<p>Houses with Dutch doors and brass gramophones,
	<p>Whose windows would not open to the world but only for each other:
	<p>To a chamber, wider, with walls farther than sight and
	<p>Ceilings unreachable even by the giants of yore.
	<p>I will hug this whiteness and I shall be one with it.
	<p>Then, too, I shall still not believe what you wrote in the
	<p>Beige postcards you send me in sun and snow.</div>

<p>I got tired of you telling me how you spent evenings
<p>Bathing in Saint-Saëns sheepishly afraid
<p>Anyone would hear what happened to the plebeian who
<p>Interpreted dreams: in the morning, filling the regal bathtub with
<p>Coffee; donning afterwards a minister's regalia,
<p>Adviser to the King, while the face is a pauper's, caffeinated;
<p>In the afternoon pushing carts by the
<p>Quayside, peddling; at sunset, touching oneself, then reading under a lamp
<p>Of unhealthy wattage.
<p>Life was spread ad valorem to those who were
<p>Insignificant enough to attend its colloquiums
<p>And the sad ones were not there, and also the blind.</div>

<p>I too danced in decadence, a young marauder sadistic as a
<p>Child, lost, lingering, in the sweaty Arabic
<p>Afternoons of Toledo, kissing the dead man
<p>Avuncular, on his lips a painted smile of surrender to
<p>Putrefaction. But never unhappiness;
<p>Never the torment of unanswered phone calls,
<p>Of messages unread a month hence while the doubt
<p>Unhinges me whether you are where you say you are.
<p>Or is it the white rooms (curtainless for here no
<p>Dawns), is it the metallic bedframes, the stainless white tiles of your floor that is
<p>Unsettling; unsettling as sexless young children or your sootfree skin and my grimy hand.
<p>I have become your disciple. To you now I appeal.
<p>Scandalised by my own nudity,
<p>Afraid of mirrors,
<p>My only comfort is
<p>Your face under a sunflower's perfect shadow,
<p>Beardless as the passive night (as potent , yes, but as
<p>Ephemeral as the bitter aftertaste of refrigerated pineapples):
<p>I have abandoned my
<p>Virility to take hold of the passing hour—
<p>Agile; unaggressive; eyes looking for wonders,
<p>Watching for signs from ghosts under a halide lamp.
