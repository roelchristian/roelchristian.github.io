    <h2>I</h2>
<div class="hangind">
    <p>The glov’d hand caresses &mdash;</p>
    <p>And at midnight some foul thing awakens,</p>
    <p>&mdash; Silent, as all monsters are, no growls, no hisses</p>
    <p>&mdash; Not even the whimper of satisfaction</p>
    <p>At seeing the prey approach &mdash;</p>
    <p>Hidden by the thrushes, hidden by the</p>
    <p>Shadows of a wet moon.</p>
</div>
<div class="hangind">
    <p>The glov’d hand caresses &mdash;</p>
    <p>And the splash of the water as the horses</p>
    <p>Muddy the stream colors the afternoon</p>
    <p>In Wordsworth’s exotica. Sweet, silent, slow</p>
    <p>It slithers. ‘Are you dressed yet for</p>
    <p>Dinner?’ It asks&hellip; the bony arms hidden in</p>
    <p>The sleeves of its macintosh.</p>
</div>
<div class="hangind">
    <p>The glov’d hand caresses &mdash;</p>
    <p>As the rain’s own little hands pat at the window.</p>
    <p>&mdash; ‘Too hot!’ she would complain, much later,</p>
    <p>Lying down by the pool as it slithers,</p>
    <p>Slowly still, silent, polite.</p>
    <p>Blue-eyed it watches, noiseless, patient</p>
    <p>While indoors the mold claims its erstwhile dominion.</p>

    <h2>II</h2>

<div class="hangind">
    <p>Annouchka is troubled in her sleep &mdash;</p>
    <p>Some ghost from the old country had been visiting</p>
    <p>Her in the evenings. &Agrave; peine sa bougie &eacute;teinte</p>
    <p>It announces its arrival. Superstitious</p>
    <p>She has asked for a s&eacute;ance, her object</p>
    <p></span>Peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="hangind">
	<p><span style="width: 5em; display: inline-block;"></span>But the solstice is near, Annouchka is told.</p>
    <p>And as it were, no English magick is potent enough</p>
    <p>To rid her her demons.</p>
</div>

<div class="hangind">
    <p><span style="width: 12em; display: inline-block;"></span>‘It is not magick I seek,’ she protests</p>
    <p>To an empty room,</p>
</div>

<div class="hangind">
    <p><span style="width: 10em; display: inline-block;"></span>&mdash; the light that filters through the</p>
    <p>Curtains fall deaf on her husband’s rabid face: lip,</p>
    <p>Eye, brow, he was not her ghost &mdash; not yet, at least,</p>
    <p>The incunabulus that has been taunting her, and</p>
    <p>What do the cards know that she doesn’t</p>
</div>
