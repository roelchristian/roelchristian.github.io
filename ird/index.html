  <p>Iridian is a linguistic experiment I&rsquo;ve been working on for a couple of years now. It is a constructed language <a href="https://i.redd.it/v29ebmkef8f31.png
">spoken in Central Europe</a>, sandwiched between present-day Czechia, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. It is a language isolate like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language">Basque</a>, and has, through centuries of contact (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/qilyu/what_is_the_actual_state_of_basque_phonology/">like Basque had</a>, too) assimilated to the general phonological trends exhibited by languages of the region. (One can argue its experience would have made the existence of a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40871253?seq=1">Central European <i>Sprachbund</i></a> a more plausible idea). Despite its distinctively Central European phonology, however, Iridian&rsquo;s morphosyntax, with its generally agglutinative nature and verb-final structure, more closely resembles Japanese and Tagalog, and to a lesser extent, Finnish and Turkish.</p>

    <caption >The initial inspiration for Iridian was of course literary. I was introduced to the idea of <a href="https://www.eurozine.com/growing-up-in-kunderas-central-europe/">Mitteleuropa</a> in the works of the Franco-Czech author Milan Kundera (pictured) and later through other writers from the region, particulary Stefan Schweig, L&aacute;szl&oacute; Krasnahorkai, and of course, Kafka. Kundera himself (who considers himself a French author and not Czech, and who has been in exile in France for more than three decades, losing his Czech citizenship in 1979 and only having it restored in 2019) is perhaps a perfect example of the geist of the region and what has interested me in it in the first place. To what extent this initial catalyst has shaped Iridian, however, is something I have yet to explore.&mdash;<em>Original photo from <a href="https://culturacolectiva.com">culturacolectiva.com</a> (<a href="https://img.culturacolectiva.com/content/2016/09/The-Unbearable-Lightness-of-Being-milan-kundera.jpg">source</a>).</em></caption>

<p>These linguistic pretentions notwithstanding, I consider Iridian more as a fun side project (a passion project, if you will, easily understandable to those who share Tolkien&rsquo;s <a href="https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm">secret vice)</a>&mdash;and although I have worked hard to make sure that the linguistic documentation is good (or as good as could be expected from an armchair linguist like myself), this hobbyist nature of the whole undertaking makes the occasional slip inevitable. (Still it must be said that the work I spent on it has made me learn more about linguistics and Central European history than what I would probably ever need elsewhere in my life.)
</p>
<p>As all other conlangs, Iridian (and will likely remain) a work in progress. What it is here now may not exactly reflect what it will become in a year&rsquo;s time, for example. Nonetheless I do think that in the couple of years I&rsquo;ve spent with the language, it has by now taken a character of its own, that any change wouldn&rsquo;t be as drastic and to significantly alter this persona.</p>

<p>Finally, Iridian was not conceived in a vacuum, and I am lucky enough to be in an era where the secret vice is not that secret anymore and where the conlanging community both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs">online</a> and <a href="https://conlang.org/">off</a> is so wonderfully vibrant. Despite me not being active in them, I have picked up here and there some wonderful tidbits and new ways to look at the world and at language even by just browsing through their archives, and the influence of languages like <a href="ayeri.de/">Carston Becker&rsquo;s Ayeri</a> (a master class in documentation), <a href="http://pearson.conlang.org/">Matt Pearson&rsquo;s Okuna</a>, <a href="https://www.veche.net/novegradian">Martin Posthumus&rsquo;s Novegradian</a> (a Slavicist&rsquo;s dream) or <a href="https://tokipona.org/">Sonja Lang&rsquo;s Toki Pona</a> (the lovely language that introduced me to the online conlang community and the only one until know  have considered learning myself) cannot be understated and I extend my thanks to them for their creations.</p>
