<h3>Oral Vowels</h3>
Iridian has six pairs of corresponding long and short vowels. With the exception of \bt{a~a:} and \bt{u~u:}, long vowels are tenser than their short counterparts. In addition standard Iridian also features the high central vowel \nt{1} as an allophone of \nt{E} and \nt{I} and the low central \nt{5} as an allophone of \nt{a}, in unstressed positions.
