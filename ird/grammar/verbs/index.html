<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Verbs in Iridian are heavily marked. There is a tendency to encode most of the information contained in the sentence on the verb leaving the noun or noun phrase unmarked if possible.
</p>
<p>Finite verbs are marked for the following grammatical categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Aspect.</b> Iridian has three primary aspects: perfective, imperfective and contemplative; and two secondary ones: retrospective and prospective.</li>
  <li>Iridian has a strong tendency to leave the topic of the sentence unmarked, instead encoding the primary information on the verb. Due to this, voice must be explicitly marked on the verb. Iridian has the following grammatical voices: agentive, patientive, benefactive, instrumental, locative and reflexive.</li>
	<li>esides the unmarked indicative, Iridian has the following grammatical moods: subjunctive, conditional, hortative, optative, abilitative, permissive and non-volitive. In addition, secondary prefixes are used to express what would otherwise could be considered as moods: inceptive, causative and reciprocative.</li>
</ol>

<p>Verbs are also marked for person, although this is done by the addition of clitic pronouns and not through a separate conjugation paradigm. In most cases, however, this is left out, especially if clear from the context. Iridian verbs are not marked for tense, gender, or number.
</p>
<p>Iridian verbs have four classes of non-finite forms: the gerund, the converb, the supine and the generic nominal formed with \textbf{-ou}. The non-finite verb forms are derived from the uninflected verb stem except the generic nominal in \textbf{-ou} which can only be formed from a fully-inflected verb stem. A fifth class exists--the infinitive--but this form is largely defunct and is only used in certain compound constructions. Infinitives end in \textbf{-á} and is used as the citation form of a verb.

\section{Verb stem and citation form}\index{citation form}\index{infinitive}

\par The citation form (or dictionary form) of a verb is the uninflected infinitive\index{infinitive}, a fossilized form rarely used outside of a very few periphrastic construction. The infinitive ends with the vowel \ird{-\'a}, and removing this ending will produce the verb stem\index{verb stem}. The final consonant  of the stem determines the conjugation paradigm the verb follows.

In general the classification of the verb stems is based on how they behave in two phonemic environments: (1) before a phoneme that triggers palatalization such as \ird{-e-}, \ird{-\'e-}, \ird{-i-} or \ird{-\'i-} or a \emph{jod}-glide; and (2) before a spirant or an affricate.


<h2 id="valency">Valency</h2>
Valency (or valence) is the number of overt arguments a verb can take in a sentence. Tesnière <a href="/ird/references#tesniere1965">(1965: 239)</a>, in one of the earliest description of the concept, likens valency by comparing it to bonds between atoms:

<blockquote>
  The verb may therefore be compared to a sort of atom, susceptible to attracting a greater or lesser number of actants, according to the number of bonds the verb has available to keep them as dependents.The number of bonds a verb has constitutes what we call the verb&rsquo;s valency.

More rigorous treatments have of course been published in the years since but we should content ourselves with this definition in our present treatment of Iridian grammar. Instead our primary focus would e

<h3>Avalent Verbs</h3>
Avalent verbs  are verbs that have zero core arguments. In Iridian they are limited to a small set of verbs that describe meteorological and other natural phenomena. When used this way they are marked in the agentive voice and essentially forms topicless sentences. Some common weather verbs in Iridian are listed below.
