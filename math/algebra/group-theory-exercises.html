            <p>Show that all groups of order $4$ are abelian.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-block">
            <p>Let $G$ be a group of order $4$. By Lagrange&rsquo;s theorem, all elements in $G$ have order $1$, $2$ or $4$. If an element $a$ has order $4$ then $G$ is cyclic,<span class="citation-note"><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Group_whose_Order_equals_Order_of_Element_is_Cyclic">[1]</a></span> and thus abelian.<span class="citation-note"><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Cyclic_Group_is_Abelian">[2]</a></span></p>
            <p>
                Otherwise suppose all non-identity elements have order $2$. Then $G = \{e, a, b, c\}$ and $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e$. By the cancellation law in groups, $ab \neq a$, $ab \neq b$ and $ab \neq e$ and therefore $ab = c$. Thus $(ab)^2 = e$, implying $ab = ba$ and the conclusion follows.

            <p>Let $\alpha \in S_n$ be an odd permutation. Show that for any $\beta \in S_n$, $\beta \alpha \beta^{-1}$ is also an odd permutation.</p>

                Since $\alpha$ is an odd permutation, it follows that the equation
                $$
                    \alpha = \tau_1 \tau_2 \cdots \tau_{m}
                $$
                where each $\tau_i$ is a transposition is true if and only if $m$ is odd. Let $\beta \in S_n$ be an arbitrary permutation whose parity we do not necessarily know. Then if
                $$
                    \beta = \tau'_1 \tau'_2 \cdots \tau'_{k}
                $$
                for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ (the $\tau_i$'s being transpositions), then $\beta^{-1}$ is also a $k$-cycle, i.e.,
                $$
                    \beta^{-1} = \tau''_1 \tau''_2 \cdots \tau''_{k},
                $$
                where again each $\tau''_i$ is a transposition. Thus we have
                $$
                \beta\alpha\beta^{-1} = (\tau'_1 \tau'_2 \cdots \tau'_{k})(\tau_1 \tau_2 \cdots \tau_{m})(\tau''_1 \tau''_2 \cdots \tau''_{k}),
                $$
                and therefore $\alpha\beta\alpha^{-1}$ has length $k + m + k = 2k + m$. Since $m$ is odd, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $m = 2n + 1$. Thus $2k + m = 2k + 2n + 1 = 2(k + n) + 1$, which is odd. Therefore $\alpha\beta\alpha^{-1}$ is an odd permutation.
