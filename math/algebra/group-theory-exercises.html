        <p>Show that all groups of order $4$ are abelian.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example-block">
        <p>Let $G$ be a group of order $4$. By Lagrange&rsquo;s theorem, all elements in $G$ have order $1$, $2$ or $4$. If an element $a$ has order $4$ then $G$ is cyclic,<span class="citation-note"><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Group_whose_Order_equals_Order_of_Element_is_Cyclic">[1]</a></span> and thus abelian.<span class="citation-note"><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Cyclic_Group_is_Abelian">[2]</a></span></p>
        <p>
            Otherwise suppose all non-identity elements have order $2$. Then $G = \{e, a, b, c\}$ and $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e$. By the cancellation law in groups, $ab \neq a$, $ab \neq b$ and $ab \neq e$ and therefore $ab = c$. Thus $(ab)^2 = e$, implying $ab = ba$ and the conclusion follows.
