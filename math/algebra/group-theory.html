<section><h2>Some preliminaries</h2>

    <p>
        A <i>set</i> is a collection of mathematical objects called its elements. </p>
        
    <p>A <i>relation</i> on a set $X$ is a subset $R$ of $X \times X$. If $(a, b) \in R$, we say that $a$ is related to $b$ by $R$ and write $R(a, b)$ or $aRb$. If $R$ is a relation on $X$, then we say that $R$ is <i>reflexive</i> if $aRa$ for all $a \in X$. We say that $R$ is <i>symmetric</i> if $aRb$ implies $bRa$ for all $a, b \in X$. We say that $R$ is <i>transitive</i> if $aRb$ and $bRc$ implies $aRc$ for all $a, b, c \in X$. If $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then we say that $R$ is an <i>equivalence relation</i> and we write $a \sim b$ instead of $aRb$. Given a set $X$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$, the equivalence class of an element $a$ of $X$ (written $[x]$) is the set
    $$[a] = \{x \in X : a \sim x\}.$$
</p>

<div class="example-block">
    <p><b>Examples.</b> Consider the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers and the equality relation ($=$). Observe that if $x$ is a real number then $x$ is equal to itself, i.e., $x = x$. Moreover, $x = y$ implies $y = x$, and vice versa, for any other real number real number $y$. Finally, if $z$ is a third real number, then $x = y$ and $y = z$ implies $x = z$. Thus, equality is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, consider the relation $&lt;$ on $\mathbb{R}$. By the trichotomy law in $\mathbb{R}$, $x &lt; y$ and $y &lt; x$ cannot both be true, and thus $&lt;$ is not symmetric and hence not an equivalence relation.</p>

    <p>Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of integers; then for all integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, with $n &gt; 1$, we define the equivalence relation $\sim$ as $a \sim b \iff n \mid (a - b).$ (The reader can verify that this is indeed an equivalence relation.) We call this relation <i>congruence modulo $n$</i> and write $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ whenever $a \sim b$.</p>

    <h2> 1. The definition of a group</h2>

    <div class="theorem-block">
        <p><b>Definition 1.1.</b> A binary operation on a set $X$ is a map $X \times X \to X$. Let $\varphi$ be a binary operation on a set $G$ and let $a, b, c$ be elements of $G$. We say that $G$ is a <i>semigroup</i> under $\varphi$ if $\varphi$ is associative, that is,
            $$\varphi(a, \varphi(b, c)) = \varphi(\varphi(a, b), c)$$
        </p>
    
        <p>We say that $G$ is a <i>monoid</i> under $\varphi$ if $G$ is a semigroup under $\varphi$ and there exists an element $e \in G$ (called the identity element) such that
            $$\varphi(e, a) = \varphi(a, e) = a$$
        for all $a \in G$.</p>
    
        <p>Finally, we say that $G$ is a <i>group</i> under $\varphi$ if $G$ is a monoid under $\varphi$ and for every $a \in G$ there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ (called the inverse of $a$) such that
            $$\varphi(a, a^{-1}) = \varphi(a^{-1}, a) = e.$$
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Observe that commutativity is not required for a group. That is, we do not require that $\varphi(a, b) = \varphi(b, a)$ for all $a, b \in G$. If $\varphi$ does, however, satisfy this property, then we say that the underlying set $G$ is an <i>abelian group</i> $\varphi$.</p> 

    <p>For the sake of brevity we will often be writing $\varphi(a, b)$ as $a \cdot b$, or, more succinctly, $ab$ (in the case of abelian groups we shall instead write $a+b$, although this decision is only a matter of convention). This shorthand also extends to calling the binary operation &lsquo;multiplication&rsquo; (or &lsquo;addition&rsquo; in the case of abelian groups) without implying that the operation is commutative or is the usual multiplication (or addition) of numbers. We will also be saying that &lsquo;$G$ is a group&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;$G$ is a group under $\varphi$&rsquo;, unless ambiguity forces us to be more precise.</p>

    <div class="example-block">
        <b>Examples.</b> The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers is a group under the usual addition of integers. The identity element is $0$ and the inverse of an integer $n$ is $-n$. The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is a group under the usual addition of rational numbers, but fails to be a group under the usual multiplication of rational numbers since $0$ has no inverse.
    </div>

    <div class="theorem-block">

        <p><b>Theorem 1.2</b> Let $G$ be a group, and $a, b, c \in G$. Then:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>$aa = a \implies a = e$</li>
            <li>Left-cancellation: $ab = ac \implies b = c$</li>
            <li>Right-cancellation: $ba = ca \implies b = c$</li>

    <h2>2. Homomorphisms and subgroups</h2>

    <p>In general, our interest in groups is usually not on the groups themselves, but rather on the maps between them. We will be interested in maps that preserve the group structure, which we call homomorphisms.</p>

    <div class="theorem-block">
        <p><b>Definition 2.1.</b> Let $G$ and $H$ be groups under $\varphi$ and $\psi$ respectively. A map $\Phi: G \to H$ is called a <i>homomorphism</i> if
            $$\Phi(\varphi(a, b)) = \psi(\Phi(a), \Phi(b))$$
        for all $a, b \in G$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A more ambiguous, though admittedly less cumbersome, way of saying this is that $\Phi$ is a homomorphism if
        $$\Phi(ab) = \Phi(a)\Phi(b).$$
    In this alternative notation, we do not distinguish between the multiplication in $G$ and the multiplication in $H$, and instead rely on context to determine which group operation we are referring to.</p>

    <p>A (group) homomorphism that is injective as a map between sets is called a <i>monomorphism</i>. A homomorphism that is surjective as a map between sets is called an <i>epimorphism</i>. A homomorphism that is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism is called an <i>isomorphism</i>. If there exists an isomorphism between $G$ and $H$, then we say that $G$ and $H$ are <i>isomorphic</i> and write $G \cong H$.</p>

    <p>A homomorphism from a group $G$ to itself is called an <i>endomorphism</i>. An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is called an <i>automorphism</i>.

    <div class="theorem-block">
        <p><b>Proposition.</b> Let $G$ and $H$ be groups with identities $e$ and $e'$ respectively, and let $a$ be an element of $G$. Let $\Phi: G \to H$ be a homomorphism. Then:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>$\Phi(e) = e'$</li>
                <li>$\Phi(a^{-1}) = \Phi(a)^{-1}$</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>That is, a homomorphism preserves identities and inverses.</p>
