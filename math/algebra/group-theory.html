<section><h2>Some preliminaries</h2>

    <p>
        A <i>set</i> is a collection of mathematical objects called its elements. We write $a \in X$ if $a$ is an element of the set $X$ and $a \notin X$ otherwise. A set is completely determined by its elements (axiom of extensionality), that is, if $X$ and $Y$ are sets then
        $$\forall a\ (a \in X \iff a \in Y) \implies X = Y.$$
        The converse of this axiom is also true and defines the notion of equality.
    </p>

    <p>
        We say that a set $B$ is a <i>subset</i> of another set $A$ and write $B \subseteq A$ if and only if
        $$a \in B \implies a \in A.$$
    </p>
        
    <p>A <i>relation</i> on a set $X$ is a subset $R$ of $X \times X$. If $(a, b) \in R$, we say that $a$ is related to $b$ by $R$ and write $R(a, b)$ or $aRb$. If $R$ is a relation on $X$, then we say that $R$ is <i>reflexive</i> if $aRa$ for all $a \in X$. We say that $R$ is <i>symmetric</i> if $aRb$ implies $bRa$ for all $a, b \in X$. We say that $R$ is <i>transitive</i> if $aRb$ and $bRc$ implies $aRc$ for all $a, b, c \in X$. If $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then we say that $R$ is an <i>equivalence relation</i> and we write $a \sim b$ instead of $aRb$. Given a set $X$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$, the equivalence class of an element $a$ of $X$ (written $[x]$) is the set
    $$[a] = \{x \in X : a \sim x\}.$$
</p>

<div class="example-block">
    <p><b>Examples.</b> Consider the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers and the equality relation ($=$). Observe that if $x$ is a real number then $x$ is equal to itself, i.e., $x = x$. Moreover, $x = y$ implies $y = x$, and vice versa, for any other real number real number $y$. Finally, if $z$ is a third real number, then $x = y$ and $y = z$ implies $x = z$. Thus, equality is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, consider the relation $&lt;$ on $\mathbb{R}$. By the trichotomy law in $\mathbb{R}$, $x &lt; y$ and $y &lt; x$ cannot both be true, and thus $&lt;$ is not symmetric and hence not an equivalence relation.</p>

    <p>Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of integers; then for all integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, with $n &gt; 1$, we define the equivalence relation $\sim$ as $a \sim b \iff n \mid (a - b).$ (The reader can verify that this is indeed an equivalence relation.) We call this relation <i>congruence modulo $n$</i> and write $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ whenever $a \sim b$.</p>

    <h2> 1. The definition of a group</h2>

    <div class="theorem-block" id="definition11">
        <p><b>Definition 1.1.</b></p><p>A binary operation on a set $X$ is a map $X \times X \to X$. Let $\varphi$ be a binary operation on a set $G$ and let $a, b, c$ be elements of $G$. We say that $G$ is a <i>semigroup</i> under $\varphi$ if $\varphi$ is associative, that is,
            $$\varphi(a, \varphi(b, c)) = \varphi(\varphi(a, b), c)$$
        </p>
    
        <p>We say that $G$ is a <i>monoid</i> under $\varphi$ if $G$ is a semigroup under $\varphi$ and there exists an element $e \in G$ (called the identity element) such that
            $$\varphi(e, a) = \varphi(a, e) = a$$
        for all $a \in G$.</p>
    
        <p>Finally, we say that $G$ is a <i>group</i> under $\varphi$ if $G$ is a monoid under $\varphi$ and for every $a \in G$ there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ (called the inverse of $a$) such that
            $$\varphi(a, a^{-1}) = \varphi(a^{-1}, a) = e.$$
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Observe that commutativity is not required for a group. That is, we do not require that $\varphi(a, b) = \varphi(b, a)$ for all $a, b \in G$. If $\varphi$ does, however, satisfy this property, then we say that the underlying set $G$ is an <i>abelian group</i> under $\varphi$.</p> 

    <p>For the sake of brevity we will often be writing $\varphi(a, b)$ as $a \cdot b$, or, more succinctly, as $ab$. (In the case of abelian groups we shall instead write $a+b$, although this decision is only a matter of convention.) This shorthand also extends to calling the binary operation &lsquo;multiplication&rsquo; (or &lsquo;addition&rsquo; in the case of abelian groups) without implying that the operation is commutative or is the usual multiplication (or addition) of numbers. We will also be saying that &lsquo;$G$ is a group&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;$G$ is a group under $\varphi$&rsquo;, unless ambiguity forces us to be more precise.</p>

    <div class="example-block">

        <p>
            <b>Examples.</b> The development of group theory has been motivated in large part by the study of symmetry. Consider a square centered at the origin.
        </p>

        <p>The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers is a group under the usual addition of integers. The identity element is $0$ and the inverse of an integer $n$ is $-n$. The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is a group under the usual addition of rational numbers, but fails to be a group under the usual multiplication of rational numbers since $0$ has no inverse.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Linear groups.</b> Consider the set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices with entries from a field $\mathbb{K}$. Then matrix multiplication is a binary operation on this set since the product of two $n \times n$ matrices is again an $n \times n$ matrix. The identity matrix $I_n$ is the identity element of this group, and the inverse of a matrix $A$ is the matrix $A^{-1}$ such that $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I_n$. (Note that we require the matrices to be invertible.) We call this group the <i>general linear group</i> of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{K}$, $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{K})$. If we consider only the set of $n \times n$ matrices with entries from $\mathbb{K}$ with determinant $1$, then we obtain the <i>special linear group</i> of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{K}$, $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{K})$.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Klein four-group.</b> Consider the matrices
            $$  a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix},\ 
                b = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix},\ 
                c = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
            When taken together with the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix $e$, these matrices form a group under matrix multiplication. This group is called the <i>Klein four-group</i> and is denoted by $V_4$ (after the German <i>Viergruppe</i>). Every element of $V_4$ is its own inverse, and multiplying any two non-identity elements of $V_4$ yields the third element. The group operation is commutative and thus the group is abelian.

        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>order</i> of a group $G$ (written $|G|$) is the cardinality of its underlying set, i.e., the number of elements of the group. If $|G| \lt \infty$, then we say that $G$ is a <i>finite group</i>; otherwise, we say that $G$ is an <i>infinite group</i>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        We can describe the structure of a finite group by arranging all possible products in the group in a grid, with the factors of each product on either end of the grid&rsquo;s rows and columns. This grid is called the <i>Cayley table</i> after British mathematician Arthur Cayley, who introduced it in his paper <i>On the Theory of Groups as depending on the Symbolic Equation $\theta^n = 1$</i> (1854). Cayley tables are particularly useful for non-abelian groups, where the product $ab$ is not necessarily equal to $ba$. Some examples of Cayley tables are shown below

    <h2>2. Homomorphisms and subgroups</h2>

    <p>In general, our interest in groups is usually not on the groups themselves, but rather on the maps between them. We will be interested in maps that preserve the group structure, which we call homomorphisms.</p>

    <div class="theorem-block">
        <p><b>Definition 2.1.</b> Let $G$ and $H$ be groups under $\varphi$ and $\psi$ respectively. A map $\Phi: G \to H$ is called a <i>homomorphism</i> if
            $$\Phi(\varphi(a, b)) = \psi(\Phi(a), \Phi(b))$$
        for all $a, b \in G$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A more ambiguous, though admittedly less cumbersome, way of saying this is as follows: $\Phi$ is a homomorphism if
        $$\Phi(ab) = \Phi(a)\Phi(b).$$
    In this alternative notation, we do not distinguish between the multiplication in $G$ and the multiplication in $H$, and instead rely on context to determine which group operation we are referring to.</p>

    <p>A (group) homomorphism that is injective as a map between sets is called a <i>monomorphism</i>. A homomorphism that is surjective as a map between sets is called an <i>epimorphism</i>. A homomorphism that is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism is called an <i>isomorphism</i>. If there exists an isomorphism between $G$ and $H$, then we say that $G$ and $H$ are <i>isomorphic</i> and write $G \cong H$.</p>

    <p>A homomorphism from a group $G$ to itself is called an <i>endomorphism</i>. An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is called an <i>automorphism</i>.

            Let $a \in G$. Then $\Phi(a)\Phi(a^{-1}) = \Phi(aa^{-1}) = \Phi(e) = e'$, so that $\Phi(a^{-1}) = \Phi(a)^{-1}$.

            A subset $H$ of a group $G$ is called a <i>subgroup</i> of $G$ if $H$ is itself a group under the operation of $G$. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then we write $H \leq G$.

        <p>
            Every subgroup of the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers is a cyclic group. In particular, if $H \leq \mathbb{Z}$, then $H = \langle 0 \rangle$ or $H = \langle m \rangle$ where $m$ is the smallest positive integer in $H$. If $H \neq \langle 0 \rangle$, then $H$ is infinite.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-block">
        <p>
            <i>Proof.</i> Either $H = \langle 0 \rangle \leq \mathbb{Z}$ or $H$ contains a least positive integer $m$ (by the well-ordering principle). We claim that $H = \langle m \rangle$ and prove it by showing that $H \subseteq \langle m \rangle$ and $\langle m \rangle \subseteq H$.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since $H$ is a subgroup and is thus closed under the binary operation of $\mathbb{Z}$, it follows that $$\langle m \rangle = \{km : k \in \mathbb{Z}\} \subseteq H$$
            (here the notation is additive). Now let $h \in H$. By the division algorithm, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that $h = qm + r$ and $0 \leq r \lt m$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $h - qm = r \in H$ (because $h, qm \in H$). But $m$ is the least positive integer in $H$, so $0 \leq r \lt m$ implies $r = 0$. Thus $h = qm \in \langle m \rangle$, and so $H \subseteq \langle m \rangle$.
        </p>
        <p>
            If $H \neq \langle 0 \rangle$, then for integers $k_1, k_2$ such that $k_1 \neq k_2$, we have $k_1m \neq k_2m$. Thus $\langle m \rangle$ is infinite.

        <p>
            Every cyclic group of infinite order is isomorphic to the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers. Every cyclic group of finite order $n$ is isomorphic to the additive group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ of integers modulo $n$.

            <i>Proof.</i> Let $G$ be a cyclic group generated by $a$. If $G$ is infinite, then the map $\Phi: \mathbb{Z} \to G$ defined by $\Phi(k) = a^k$ is a homomorphism since for all integers $\kappa, \lambda$, we have
            $$\Phi(\kappa + \lambda) = a^{\kappa + \lambda} = a^{\kappa}a^{\lambda} = \Phi(\kappa)\Phi(\lambda).$$
            Since $G$ is cyclic, every element of $G$ is a power of $a$ and therefore $\Phi$ is surjective. <!--Finally, for all integers $\kappa, \lambda$, with $\kappa \neq \lambda$, we have $a^{\kappa} \neq a^{\lambda}$, and so $\Phi$ is injective. Thus $\Phi$ is an isomorphism and $G \cong \mathbb{Z}$.-->By <a href="#theorem24">Theorem 2.4</a>, $\Phi$ is a monomorphism if and only if $\operatorname{Ker} \Phi = \{0\}$
        </p>

        <p>
            Now consider the case where $G$ is finite of order $n$. For $r, s \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $a^r = a^s$ if and only if $a^{r-s} = e$, i.e., if and only if $r - s \in \operatorname{Ker} \Phi$.
