  <p>While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
  <p>I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
  <p>You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
  <p>You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
  <p>And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
  <p>Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
  </div>

  <div class="sec-wrap">
  <p>At fourteen I married My Lord you.
  <p>I never laughed, being bashful.
  <p>Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
  <p>Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.
  </div>

  <div class="sec-wrap">
  <p>At fifteen I stopped scowling,
  <p>I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
  <p>Forever and forever, and forever.
  <p>Why should I climb the look out?
  </div>

  <div class="sec-wrap">
  <p>At sixteen you departed,
  <p>You went into far Ku-to-Yen, by the river of swirling eddies,
  <p>And you have been gone five months.
  <p>The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.
  <p>You dragged your feet when you went out.
  <p>By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
  <p>Too deep to clear them away!
  <p>The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
  <p>The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
  <p>Over the grass in the West garden,
  <p>They hurt me,
  <p>I grow older,
  <p>If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
  <p>Please let me know beforehand,
  <p>And I will come out to meet you,
  <p style="margin-left:20%;">As far as Cho-fu-Sa.
