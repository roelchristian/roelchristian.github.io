<div class="hangind">
  <p>Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots
  <p>And saying: When shall we get back to our country?
  <p>Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our foemen,
  <p>We have no comfort because of these Mongols.
  <p>We grub the soft fern-shoots,
  <p>When anyone says "Return," the others are full of sorrow.
  <p>Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry and thirsty.
  <p>Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let his friend return.
  <p>We grub the old fern-stalks.
  <p>We say: Will we be let to go back in October?
  <p>There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort.
  <p>Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our country.
  <p>What flower has come into blossom?
  <p>Whose chariot? The General's.
  <p>Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong.
  <p>We have no rest, three battles a month.
  <p>By heaven, his horses are tired.
  <p>The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them
  <p>The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory arrows and quivers ornamented with fish-skin.
  <p>The enemy is swift, we must be careful.
  <p>When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,
  <p>We come back in the snow,
  <p>We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,
  <p>Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?
