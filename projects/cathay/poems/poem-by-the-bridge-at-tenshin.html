		<p>March has come to the bridge head,
		<p>Peach boughs and apricot boughs hang over a thousand gates,
		<p>At morning there are flowers to cut the heart,
		<p>And evening drives them on the eastward-flowing waters.
		<p>Petals are on the gone waters and on the going,
		<p style="margin-left:20%">And on the back-swirling eddies,
		<p>But to-days men are not the men of the old days,
		<p>Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail.
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>The sea's colour moves at the dawn
		<p>And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne,
		<p>And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo,
		<p>And clings to the walls and the gate-top.
		<p>With head-gear glittering against the cloud and sun,
		<p>The lords go forth from the court, and into far borders.
		<p>They ride upon dragon-like horses,
		<p>Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow-metal,
		<p>And the streets make way for their passage.
		<p style="margin-left:40%">Haughty their passing,
		<p>Haughty their steps as they go into great banquets,
		<p>To high halls and curious food,
		<p>To the perfumed air and girls dancing,
		<p>To clear flutes and clear singing;
		<p>To the dance of the seventy couples;
		<p>To the mad chase through the gardens.
		<p>Night and day are given over to pleasure
		<p>And they think it will last a thousand autumns,
		<p style="margin-left:30%">Unwearying autumns.
		<p>For them the yellow dogs howl portents in vain,
		<p>And what are they compared to the lady Riokushu,
		<p style="margin-left:30%">That was cause of hate!
		<p>Who among them is a man like Han-rei
		<p style="margin-left:30%">Who departed alone with his mistress,
		<p>With her hair unbound, and he his own skiffs-man!
