<div class="hangind">
<p>The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,
<p>It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,
<p>And I let down the crystal curtain
<p>And watch the moon through the clear autumn.

<em>Note.</em>â€”Jewel stairs, therefore a palace. Grievance, therefore there is something to complain, of. Gauze stockings, therefore a court lady, not a servant who complains. Clear autumn, therefore he has no excuse on account of weather. Also she has come early, for the dew has not merely whitened the stairs, but has soaked her stockings. The poem is especially prized because she utters no direct reproach.</div>
