    <h2>
        Verb stem and order of inflectional affixes
    </h2>
    <p>
        The citation form (or dictionary form or lemma) of a verb is the uninflected infinitive. This is a fossilized form and is not used in the language outside of this one purpose. The infinitive ends with the vowel <span class="cyr">-а̀</span> or <span class="cyr">-я̀</span>, and removing this ending will produce the verb stem. The final consonant of the stem is called the thematic consonant and determines the conjugation paradigm the verb follows. The verbal stem may appear independently either as a bare imperative or as a deverbal noun.

    <h2>
        Aspect
    </h2>
    <p>
        group aspect (or simply aspect) is a category in Iridian that is used to denote how an action or state described by a verb extends over time. Aspect contrasts with tense which situates an action or event as happening or being true at some specific point in time. Iridian does not mark tense grammatically, as does English, for example, and so the verb in English sentences ‘I am watching a movie on TV now’ and ‘I was watching a movie on TV when you called’ will both be translated using the same verb in the progressive aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aspect also contrasts with lexical aspect or aktionsart in that the latter, although also describing a verb’s structure in relation to time, refers more to an inherent property of the verb itself and is thus often invariant. Iridian also does not grammaticalize aktionsart, and thus the distinction between, say, Polish imperfective <span class="foreign-text">pisać</span>, ‘to write’ and perfective <span class="foreign-text">napisać</span>, ‘to write down,’ is not one made in the language (cf. Richardson 2007: 9–26; Comrie 1976).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Perfective and retrospective aspect
    </h3>
    <p>
        Both the perfective aspect and the retrospective are used to represent actions that have been completed at some point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The perfective aspect indicates an action that has been completed at some specific point in time. The thematic ending for the perfective aspect is <span class="cyr">-ек</span> 
        , but the initial <span class="cyr">-е</span>  is unstable and changes depending on the environment. It becomes <span class="cyr">-и</span>  after the patientive <span class="cyr">-ин-</span>  and the benefactive <span class="cyr">-ѐб-</span>; the use with the passive <span class="cyr">-ин-</span> also triggers the syncope of the initial <span class="cyr">-и-</span> in <span class="cyr">-ин-</span> or its conversion to an <span class="cyr">-е-</span> where sonority rules do not allow the resulting consonant cluster. Thus a verb like <span class="cyr">пяшта̀</span>, ‘to eat’ will have the forms <span class="cyr">пяштник</span>, ‘was eaten’ and <span class="cyr">пяштѐбик</span>, ‘was fed’ instead of <span class="cyr">*пяштинек</span> and <span class="cyr">*пяштѐбек</span>, respectively.
