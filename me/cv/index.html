<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>Infosys BPM, Ltd.</h3>
<p>I was hired as a Spanish resource for a engagement with a US-based client. I also created a tool to automate ticket tracking and report generation for use in monitoring weekly and monthly account performance. I also worked with the Quality team to assess engagement opportunities and ways to better deal with engagement data by standardizing collection and archiving. Recently I joined a Continuous Improvement training where I submitted a six-sigma project aimed at reducing turnaround time for one of our LOBs.</p>
<h3>Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc.</h3>
<p>I was one of the pioneer members of the Latin America governance data team in ISS, the leading corporate governance firm in the world. I created data manuals for Latin American markets, based on reporting requirements for eight countries (the largest ones being Brazil and Mexico) and the US (for dual filers). The data we dealt with included audit practices, company financials, capital and stock structure, and board composition, independence and compensation, among others.
</p><p>
I also helped standardize the work process by liaising with governance data teams in other market groups to align market policies with best practices. I also participated in and led cross-department trainings, mainly in relation to corporate governance practices for Latin American markets, particularly Brazil.
</p>

<h3>Vends Media, Ltd.</h3>
<p>I translated and managed sites for French and Portuguese for Vends Media, a London-based tourism agency. The documents I translated are mostly related to tourism and marketing.
  </p>
<h3>Agrinurture, Inc.</h3>
As an accounting intern for Agrinurture, a Philippines-based export-oriented manufacturing company, I prepared monthly bank reconciliation of cash flows, filed expense reports and performed periodic inventory checks.
