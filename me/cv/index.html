<h1>Hi, I'm Roel Christian!</h1>
<div>
I’m a data scientist specializing in providing IT and financial solutions. Having worked mostly with Latin American markets, I have built a solid track record in data analytics and data management, with a view of existing regulatory and accounting requirements. I am an innovator and a team player, and have contributed in improving and streamlining the processes of the teams I have been a part of, creating manuals and developing tools for automation. Currently I am working as a Master Data Management Specialist at Vertiv Co. (formerly Emerson Network Power).
