  <p>One of the reasons why I decided to abandon Wordpress was because of how clunky it could be. My original page was never interaction-heavy, as it’s main purpose was (and still is) to be a place where I can display the stuff I wrote or made. Thus the decision to make the whole site static. Thus <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jekyll</a>. I have tried to make this site as simple and as minimalistic as I could,&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and that, to some success I’d like to think.</p>
  
  <p>The main css file for this site has been forked from the <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufte-CSS project,</a> which is itself inspired by the design philosophy of the American statistician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edward Tufte.</a> I found it while searching for CSS frameworks that did a decent job dealing with footnotes (I can be fond of footnotes) and fell in love with how elegantly it made footnotes (read: sidenotes) appear for the web.</p>
  
  <p>The main typeface used throughout the site is <a href="https://rsms.me/inter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inter,</a> designed by  <a href="https://rsms.me/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rasmus Andersson.</a></p>
