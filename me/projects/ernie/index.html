<p>Ernie is a natural-language processing (NLP) algorithm built on top of Google’s BERT that takes as input any number of words or sentences describing a company’s business operations and outputs a GICS industry and sub-industry code. This industry-segmentation tool is trained on data scraped from publicly-available corporate datasets (such as Yahoo! Finance, EDGAR, and DBPedia) and helps address the need that is now addressed proprietary and often costly customer or vendor segmentation solutions.</p>
